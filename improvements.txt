I should make a type alias for the HashMap<String, HashMap<String, f64>>
Add git support
rewrite in rust the part where the input is cleaned
I should also watch the video about cleaning the data, to understand what is happening there
I must run cargo run from the main directory, otherwise the file read fails, fix that
Add shitposting capabilities. By that I mean add some funny dataset
preferably allow for easy change of n_gram without the need to search for a pair to star
