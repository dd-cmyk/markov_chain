FAQ:
>How do I activate Windows?
https://github.com/massgravel/Microsoft-Activation-Scripts
HWID mimics upgrade activation to generate a permanent legitimate license. (non-VL only)

>>Which W10 version should I install?
>Home/Pro
Comes with bloatware apps (games, music, news, etc) and bloatware system apps
>Edu/Workstation/Enterprise
Comes with bloatware system apps (weather, people, onedrive, teams, etc).
>LTSC, 5 years support VL-KMS only
>IoT LTSC, 10 years support HWID only
Comes with Win32 system utils, no MS Store, no apps. It's basically W10: W7 Edition
If you need MS Store, run this in cmd: wsreset -i
Install Xbox/Gamebar apps for feature parity with other versions.

>Do I even need IoT LTSC?
W10 Home/Pro/Edu/Ent editions end support in 2025, LTSC in 2027, IoT LTSC in 2032.

>How do I activate Office?
https://github.com/abbodi1406/KMS_VL_ALL_AIO/releases
Emulated KMS server, not ideal as it can trip AV and deactivate. Alternatively, use MSOffice through your browser since it's free.
Or you can try OnlyOffice/LibreOffice and set it to save as MSOffice file formats.

I compulsorily activated a windows 10 pro license with that hwid thing
After a year or so of use I realize I've no use for windows 10 and it probably (source: my ass) takes too many resources from my lenovo thinkpad x230 (i'm not a computer wizard, it was a gift)
How do I downgrade to windows 7? I've never done this
please don't call me a retard
--- 92790744
>>92790362
You don't downgrade windows, you just reinstall the old version. You don't want to run Windows 7. I'm not going to tell you to buy a new laptop or install linux, but either of those is better than Windows 7 if you can't run Windows 10 properly.

Have you considered backing all your stuff up and reinstalling Windows 10 fresh?

>Have you considered backing all your stuff up and reinstalling Windows 10 fresh?
I have, but I was hoping I could do otherwise. I trust you, so I guess I'll do that. What about this LTSC version mentioned above? Would that be better if I consider regular versions to be too full of intrusive apps? I really only need office for real life stuff (and I could use Google Docs for that I think) and miscellaneous software for private needs. Or is the Education version install from the rentry for retards a good balance for a retard like me?
--- 92791142

I have my SSD partitioned in two, one for Windows and another for files. I started having this problem where the partition for files loses its label (F:) and it's as if the partition didn't exist. I have to open the Partition Manager and re-assign the label to fix it. What could cause this?

Holy fuck I can't believe it's not just me. I thought I screwed something up. Simplewall has worked flawlessly for me since switching to Windows 10 with a new build in August.

Since copying all my data files from a 1TB Western Digital Black hdd to a 2TB Samsung EVO ssd, Windows 7 is stuck in an infinite reboot loop unless the old hdd has a sata power cable connected to it. The system is running Windows 7 64 bit from another ssd.

Any ideas on what is causing this and how to fix it so I can disconnect the hdd?
--- 92800208
>>92798762
Never ever touch anything with Hewlett Packard again. Fuck HP. That zombie corp should die already.
--- 92800265
>>92800172
You should try unmounting the hdd while booted in the OS, doing a full shutdown afterwards, and then disconnecting it physically.
--- 92800289
>>92800172
Was the WD Black HDD plugged into the computer back when you installed Windows 7 on it? In that case it might've put some system components on it without telling you so now the OS won't boot without it connected. This is why guides say to only have the drive you want to install Windows to connected during setup time, then you can plug in the storage drive later.
--- 92800419
>>92800265
The drive doesn't even need to have the data cable connected to it for Windows to boot properly. As soon as I disconnected the power from it, the problem occurs.
>>92800289
It was so long ago I don't remember for sure, but I probably did have the hdd connected when I installed the OS. Why would connecting only the power resolve the reboot loop? I even tried connecting another ssd in place of the hdd and experienced the same reboot loop.

I wanna ask here again since last thread, the recommendation was kinda bunk. 
Any recommendations for a photo repair program?
Recently got into dicking around with older digital cameras and they don't always have the most reliable forms of memory. Don't care if the image is damaged, i just want to view them. Most recovery software seems to be just deleted file recovery programs too instead of something to repair corrupted jpgs too.

Last thread, someone suggested Stellar Phoenix JPEG Repair, but that requires a paid-for license.

IoT LTSC can't be upgraded to, you need to do a full wipe.

does using atlasos over mgmt toolkit give any advantages?
--- 92802288
>>92802245
AtlasOS is basically a completely gutted 10 20H2 install made specifically to play games optimally, so if you miss any drivers or some such that aren't included in its ISO it includes a folder on the desktop that includes ways to re-install said drivers you might be missing that you need.
--- 92802327
>>92802288
alright thank you, so its basically shit
--- 92802348
>>92802327
Wouldn't say that. Just 10 but very paired down.
Should run basically how you want it to, like you obviously want to play lots of games if you're looking at a gaming-focused custom Windows. Also carves out all the telemetry as standard for custom ISO projects.

no, I don't really want to play many games, I was just wondering if there was something that atlasos did better than mgmt since I need a clean install, but I guess not. and the fact that it's stuck with 20h2 isn't for me. I guess I'll stuck with mgmt
--- 92802561
>>92802540
You should check out Tiny11 as well if you're in the mood for custom ISOs. Same kind of deal but not *as" paired down, but paired down enough that it can run on a computer with 2GB of RAM and the base install ends up being around 8GB in size.

I'd recommend the no-sysreq release so you can install 11 through it on anything.

What's the best third party video player for Windows? I'm getting a bit tired of Windows media player mainly because I can't open multiple video files at the same time.
I don't want to use MPV or VLC because those have dogshit UI. Is there anything that looks as good as WMP?
--- 92803810
>>92803792
Well mpv is the best one you could use, and if you want a third-party UI for it there's plenty of options. mpv-easy, mpv.net, Haruna, SMPlayer and Kawaii Player to name a few.
--- 92803866
>>92803810
Mpv.net looks like the best option. I wanted something that didn't use Directshow or MF because then I can delete my codec packs, since I have a suspicion they are interfering with some games I want to play (nier replicant).
--- 92803869
can someone recomend me a picasa like image viewer
if there is not a good updated program recomend me a decent one
no nomacs thanks you
--- 92803887
>>92803866
Well mpv uses its own codec packs via ffmpeg so you should be all good. You can also "install" it to your system (as it comes portable) via cut/pasting the unzipped files to an mpv folder you create in Program Files then running the mpv_install script inside one of the folders. Then you can choose it as a default video/music program.
--- 92803969

its ugly too
vlc is ugly mpv is ugly and everything based on mpv is ugly
WMP is the only media player that isn't ugly
whatever player I use it basically can't be open source, because 99% of the time that means they pay no attention to UI and they just slap their own home-rolled janky looking menus and buttons together with no regard for whether it looks halfway decent

VLC looks like a legacy app too but it doesnt fit in with windows 7
it looks like it came from windows 2000 which is all well and good when it's a regular app that does "serious stuff" but not when it's got video playing in it
do you understand what I'm saying?
I want the media controls to be overlaid on top of the videos and fade away when not used
not always there in a chunky block at the bottom
and I want legacy context menu, not like mpv
the fact is, designing UI for a media player isn't easy. only WMP and the various Mac-based media players get it right (and I'm not going to fuck around with hackintosh bullshit anymore, everything else about mac is crap)

Trespassing in California is a misdemeanor according to Penal Code 602, and someone convicted of it faces up to 6 months in a county jail *and* a fine of up to $1,000. I'm sure the county jail hurts more, though.

>>92804635
>you can't have a gun
You don't make sense. Any US citizen who is of age and not convicted of a felony (meaning he's been in jail/prison for over a year) can have guns. New York tried to have people apply for permits for over a century, but that law was nuked by the Supreme Court last January.

What's more, California uses the "Stand your ground" doctrine, meaning that you can legally shoot anyone if you believe they threaten you, which is totally the case if they break into your home. Which isn't necessarily the case if they throw garbage into my home, which is why I minimally assumed criminal trespass and not burglary.
--- 92804787

I've tried the repair option from the Windows 7 disc used to originally install the OS and get an error message:
>This version of System Recovery Options is not compatible with the version of Windows your are trying to repair.

I've tried creating and using a windows recovery disc and it repaired something in windows boot manager (I have a picture of the repair details on my phone if this info is helpful) but this didn't solve the issue. This was before I realized that if I had the old hdd connected, it boots to windows fine. I thought that maybe something copied to new data drive incorrectly. Maybe I ticked the "copy MBR" in ghost 15 for the data drive and this was somehow causing the problem. I copied the entire drive again and after making the old hdd inactive and setting the drive letter on the new ssd it booted. All my files were on the new drive and the system booted without incident. It was only after disconncting the hdd did I notice the problem persisted.

I've tried every combination of different sata ports on the mb, different sata cables, different 12v sata power cables, different 12v ports on the psu. Nothing made a difference.
--- 92805690
>>92805519
Yeah but you realize that if ONLY the power line is connected, and removing the power line causes a problem, it cannot possibly be a software issue, right? The SATA power goes directly into the PSU. There is no way for sofwtare to know, even if it wanted to, what is connected to the various power lines on the PSU. A software problem can be entirely ruled out. Try testing with the "magic HDD" physically outside of the computer case, too - just a hunch on my part. And make sure when you plug in the power cable for the magic HDD it doesn't touch or interfere with any other cables, since SATA cables can be extremely physically unreliable especially if they're worn out or bad quality.
>I've tried every combination of different sata ports on the mb, different sata cables, different 12v sata power cables, different 12v ports on the psu. Nothing made a difference.
Nothing made a difference as in, the "magic drive" had to be connected to power for things to work? As long as it's connected to *any* power cable everything works?

Ghost Specter or Tiny11 are pretty alright from what I've tried. Tiny11 is a lot more stock compared.

correct

All drives have been out of the case since I began this process.

The one uploaded by NTDEV himself on Archive is the one you download. Also get the no-sysreq ISO.

I have two dumb questions. First, I got a second hand pc and it has W10 Pro activated with a digital license.

Will the system detect is still the same pc as before and activate automatically, or do I need to add my MS account? Second question, is there an easy way to downgrade to W10 from 11? I already upgraded to 11 but I'm not sure if I like it, can I just make the clean install I mentioned before with a w10 image and i'll keep the license?

10 Enterprise IoT LTSC is the most official way to basically get a completely stock 10 experience with no first or third party apps installed besides Edge and admin tools. It's as easy as just getting the ISO, flashing it to a USB using something like Rufus then booting into said USB, wiping the Pro install with diskpart's clean command via the shift+f10 command prompt then just installing it and getting to your new desktop.
--- 92808552

Bros how do I make an installation disk for IoT LTSC? I've never had to do it before so I'm not sure of the steps. My thumbdrive is only 4GB which Microsoft insists is fine. However also according to them you need at least 5GB and according to others you need at least 16GB so making an installation DVD or whatever seems like the easiest option.

Hi, /fwt/. I'm primarily a GNU/Linux user, but I like overclocking and plan to make a Windows install just to tweak my new AM5 system. Last time I did this was when Zen 2 launched, and you could get Windows 7 to work on AM4, so I just used my old install and it mostly just worked.

Getting AM5/X670 to work with it seems like a much bigger pain in the ass, so I might as well make a temporary Windows install just to play with tweaking PBO2, RAM timings and overclock stability testing. Maaaybe play some games every now and then.

What Windows version do you guys recommend?
My requirements are:
- decent performance with Zen 4 CPUs
- ability to minimize botnet data collection as much as I can
- plays nice with my RX 6800

Some flexibility to rice it is also welcome. I remember ClassicShell was used to get rid of the new Windows 10/11 menu, is that still a thing? I would love to get Aero working or something.

You want Windows 10 IoT LTSC from the OP post. Comes with nothing but IE, Edge, and Powershell. Windows store and it's apps don't even exist, like if you click "open in paint3D" in paint, nothing happens. If you're a linux user you'll like it, it's actually more stripped down than even most official versions of 7 were.

>>92808552
Windows Setup doesn't let you do that anymore, at least not in the GUI, you have to do what this guy says: >>92807320 and you have to do it from CMD by invoking shift+F10.

>>92810107
It probably is fine for their installation media maker thing they package on 10/11, but you're trying to boot the IoT .iso that you're not even supposed to have, which is 4.9GB, so that's not gonna work. Burn it to a DVD or install Ventoy on an 8GB or larger drive. Make sure you match the MBR/GPT setup you have on your PC (including if secure boot is on or off) when you setup Ventoy. Once Ventoy is installed, you just copy any .iso to it and you can boot from it, it's like an oldschool chainloader.

Fuck I didn't think about that. Good point.
This Ventoy thing seems the best option (my old skool blank DVDs are also too small it seems because they're only 4.7GB), but I'm too retarded to understand exactly what I'm to do with it.
I'm thinking at this point I'm better off just buying a larger thumbdrive because at least it would come in handy in the future.
--- 92814449
>>92814326
Ventoy is really easy. Just get the program and plugin your USB drive you want to use for Ventoy. Select MBR or GPT depending on what the rest of your setup is, if you're running something recent and didn't set it up yourself it's probably GPT, and turn Secure Boot on or off, select the right drive and hit install. The Ventoy drive should appear in your devices list, as a single device if you went MBR or two if you went GPT. Copy the .iso to the device named VENTOY and you're good to go. If you went with GPT, it's the device that doesn't have subfolders, the other one will have folders with names like EFI already in it.

Ventoy will boot you to a grub-like interface where you can just run the .iso. You can also use it to boot Windows if your bootloader gets messed up.

>>92814149
Command to do so is in the OP post.

I've been switching hardware parts and formatting my computer to treat fucking random BSOD's with different errors since November. 
First it was WHEA-unCORRECTABLE_ERROR for three months while I tested SSDs and other hardware and slots. Finally got to editing my registry and seeing the error code on the top of the BSOD screen. From the "0X00...010" error code people on the Microsoft forums coined it as a nvme slot issue. So decide to do out with my entire motherboard because of it after 3 months of it crashing every time I stressed my PC.

Now, after two weeks of very stable use, I have gotten 3 different BSOD's in the interval of 12 hours that are while the computer was under little to no stress, so I can't even reproduce them.

Specs:R5 3600X / Gainward Phoenix RTX 3070 / Cougar VTE 600W PSU / 12GB RAM 3200Mhz from XPG / B450M Steel Legend Mobo / 1TB 7200RPM Sata + 512Gb M.2 SSD

BSOD's have been:
>page fault in non paged area
>kmode exception not handled
I cleaned my RAM sticks and slots afterwards and have now gotten a new one
>memory management

What the fuck is going on. I just want to be done with this.
--- 92814554

--- 92814826
>>92814554
It may also be a hundred other different shit, says all sources, as it could be some kernel connected to multiple processes instead of a single hardware problem.

Error code was
0x0000001a (0x0000000000041790, 0xffffaa8001db2b40, 0x0000000000000004, 0x0000000000000005).

Any ideas? Apparently parameter 1 of 0x41790 means "A page table page has been corrupted. On a 64-bit version of Windows, parameter 2 contains the address of the PFN for the corrupted page table page. On a 32-bit version of Windows, parameter 2 contains a pointer to the number of used PTEs, and parameter 3 contains the number of used PTEs."

But I don't know what any of that means

--- 92815117
>>92814826
>A page table page has been corrupted
Not necessarily. Windows allows memory to be swappable to the page file for historic reasons, even if it's kernel memory. Problem is, there are pages that shouldn't be swapped out - ever - because they're being used in interrupt handlers (when hardware events trigger, like a user moved the mouse or a network package was sent). Interrupt handlers have to return as quickly as possible, which isn't the case when some crucial data has been swapped out to disk and now has to be reloaded (CPU registers have the fastest access times, after that come caches, after that come NUMA caches, if applicable, after that comes RAM, after that come mass storage devices, and after that comes network) - and when the kernel detects that such a thing is happening it kills itself with exactly that error code.

I usually just disable the pagefile, but I can afford it (64 GB RAM).

fwiw, I perfomed some experiments with Win7, 8.1, and 10, using Simplewall. On Win7, I can block 'system' service, and everything works fine. However, with 8.1, &amp; 10, if I block 'system' , I can no longer connect to the internet. I remember reading a long time ago that M$ had made deep kernel-level changes that would allow M$ to do shit users would not normally want an OS to do online. M$ likely just enabled some shit, and digitally raped you. 

Reminder, Simplewall is not a 'firewall' in and of itself.

You can also use win10 debloater + there is some tool that allows you to remove certain components from windows installation image like edge and other shit.
>Now either use the MS Store or winget to install a web browser of your choosing and get everything else you need from there
Or just put the browser installation media on a pendrive.
I'd rather use IOT LTSC anyway so I wouldn't have to deal with win store and other shit.

Having an installer or something like a Ninite installer on a USB beforehand is also good. And yes if you want to debloat the first party apps from an Education install you could use something like Bloatbox on 10 or Bloatynosey on 11.

I thought 8th gen was the cutoff, but no just stick with 10 LTSC if you're already comfortable with it. You won't miss anything not changing to 11 on this mini PC.

One use to exist in CCMaker but it stopped working a good couple years ago. Best you can get is the releases of Adobe products by m0nkrus, whom the CCMaker dev works with.

On the [Apps] tab, blocking picrel on 7 causes no issues. In fact I have M$ crap blocked. Under 8-10, blocking this same process, breaks connectivity. Networking via WIFI refuses to conect to my access point. Have not tried this with a wired connection, but I suspect the result would be the same.

Oh. That could explain why I don't have any issues with my rig (connected via ethernet), but a friend of mine whom I've set up his machine sometimes has to manually connect to his local Wifi. Oh well.
