Before asking for help, please check our list of resources.

If you would like to try out GNU+Linux you can do one of the following:
1) Use a live image and to boot directly into the GNU+Linux distribution without installing anything.
2) Keep using your current OS and run GNU+Linux in VMware for W## or Parallels for macOS.
3) Do the reverse of step 2 in QEMU.
4) Replace everything with GNU+Linux.

Resources: Please spend at least a minute to check a web search engine with your question.

 Im about to install gentoo as my main OS now, the first time, and i still ahve a quick question regarding use flags

 Ill choose the desktop profile, this comes with a shit ton of flags, but will I really need all of them? If i install this on my normla main desktop where I will also need much normie shit, i feel like i dont even need the possibility of use flags.

 except for bluetooth or wayland gnome or such shit, i suppose i will need everything else. Is there kind off collection of useflags one should block and allow?
 or do I always need to go back to the config file of portage before compiling a program to check if I have every useflag i need?

 What if a useflag isnt blocked and also isnt allowed, just simply not there?

>do I always need to go back to the config file of portage before compiling a program to check if I have every useflag i need?
Well, I do this anyway so I don't miss any extra features of a program. But the USE= in your /etc/portage/make.conf will take care of most of this, and when running emerge always use emerge --ask so it will show whats enabled and whatnot for the specific package(s).
>What if a useflag isnt blocked and also isnt allowed, just simply not there?
Not sure what this question means, but whenever a program needs to use a flag thats blacklisted by you, typically emerge will stop you from installing said program completely until you make an exception to allow a certain useflag in /etc/portage/package.use
>Ill choose the desktop profile, this comes with a shit ton of flags, but will I really need all of them? If i install this on my normla main desktop where I will also need much normie shit, i feel like i dont even need the possibility of use flags.
Yeah, it's unnecessary bloat IMO.

>Bros I'm considering making the full on switch from Windows to Linux
I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.

Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called Linux, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.

There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called Linux distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux.

I misread this ^, no, you do not need to look inside of your make.conf every time before you install a program. Like I said in my post emerge --ask will show you what flags are being used, and for specific programs you can enable them by editing /etc/portage/package.use/genericnamehere

3 days I've been trying to get a flatpak and pulseaudio working on musl void.
Fuck. Me.
I keep getting the same two errors near the start of the thing about it's being unable to connect.
01:54:30.901 | ERROR | main_thread | AudioModule | setupAudioDriver: audio output open failed
01:54:30.901 | ERROR | main_thread | MuseSamplerLibHandler | MuseSamplerLibHandler: Unable to open MuseSampler library, path: /root/.var/app/org.musescore.MuseScore/data/MuseSampler/lib/libMuseSamplerCoreLib.so

I have pulseaudio, pipewire, dbus, installed.
I'd installed packages listed in voiddocs possible fixes.
For both pulseaudio and pipewire-pulse, I've tried launching as runit services, executing them as as is, executing through dbus-run-session.
I tried understanding pulseaudio, and it's so abstruse, but I got mpv playing something some-fucking-how, so I took that as it working.
Still no.

Any information and or help I'd appreciate.
Void won't be updating the package anything soon, my guess, and building the shit fails on me, with cmake being obtuse as usual, so flatpak is the only alternative.

>What if a useflag isnt blocked and also isnt allowed, just simply not there?
I meant, for example bluetooth or qt.
When I do NOT have bluetooth in the USE= area, not even blacklisted NOR listed, what will happen? 

Also, i questioned it not very understandable, do I even need use flags? I will soon get an x200 with not a lot of storage space, then gentoo is the perfect OS with its use flags, but i have a strong computer, what real benefits do I get from using gentoo over Artix?

Adding*
I am right now choosing use flags, When i choose eselect profile 5, which is for desktop use with X support,
i get much fucking useflags,

u said its bloat. So as I understand, when I dont put in that much and e.g. copy someones uselfags like mental outlaws ones form the video, and i want to install something but dont have the right use flags, itll warn me, and i can add them then and continue compiling the program?

Should i then just put a few useflags in now, and let them be naturally added while i build my desktop environment or just put in everything from the giant profile?
--- 92796298

side question, when choosing hardened profile, will this make stuff harder to install or so? i also plan on playing games on steam for example, what does a hardened profile change, cuz if not something significant why wouldnt everyone choose a hardened

you need a space there. It should be " --ask --verbose". Also, protip: "-avuDN" is the same as "--ask --verbose --update --deep --newuse" except with less typing.

So, sry for asking so much, 

I am currently in a few important choices and I cant find articles explaining it good enough,

i choose the hardened SElinux profile now, (i already chose the default desktop profile, and put in these useflags inthe make.conf, but I can choose hardened/selinux again) 

Then questions and worries, I dont understand very well what profiles exactly do except for changing useflags, when changing to hardened/SElinux i do not have the desktop profile chosen, so is it any important to choose the desktop profile if I want to use dwm with X?
if not why do these profile exist except for pre given useflags?

Hardened has fewer useflags set by default, but that probably won't matter. Just set the useflags you need as you go along. dwm is pretty minimal, so I can't see you having too many problems here.
>shouldnt I have used the hardened/selinux tarball then? should I start over?
Yeah, you should probably start over.

in that file you just need to put the command and &amp; after it so you can launch multiple commands and it wont just wait till that program gets closed

er, I misspoke, emerge doesn't actually automatically update your config files like that. I can see why you're confused now. Either run dispatch-conf or manually update your useflags (I'd suggest making a file in /etc/portage/package.use/ for Qt related use-flags).

The error say no acceptable C compiler found in $PATH. Do I just install gcc/cc (I'm assuming they're C compilers)?.
--- 92798403
>>92798248
Sure. Whenever a config file is updated by portage you need to run dispatch-conf to update it. dispatch-conf is a tool for managing updates to configuration files. If a package updates a config file or emerge wants you to add a useflag you'll need to use it. You can roll back changes using it as well.

Basically here's what happened: you added a file with the text from your screenshot (the # required by comments and the package atom/useflags) to your portage configuration.

>Dynamic Kernel Module Support (DKMS) is a program/framework that enables generating Linux kernel modules whose sources generally reside outside the kernel source tree. The concept is to have DKMS modules automatically rebuilt when a new kernel is installed.

If I'm reading this right, it means the nvidia driver isn't part of the kernel itself like AMD, so it's pulled from somewhere else.
--- 92799558

I can appreciate Oracle not putting trash into their yum repositories but does anyone know where I could find programs such as maim, scrot, anki, etc.? Oracle Linux is supposedly RHEL-compatible so I probably wouldn't break too much shit if I configured dnf to use some 3rd party repo

I'm really loving linux after using it exclusively for ~6 months. No more worries about windows licenses and the latest incursions on your privacy. Always loved GIMP. Got games to work in wine. Even the video editor kdenlive is fucking excellent and so fast. Have probably installed and tried 6-7 different distros by now on a variety of computers, including minimal debian with openbox and lightdm.

Any recommendations for youtube videos with tips and tricks for intermediary users? I want to learn more but whenever I search the topic I either get complete newbie stuff or really autistic stuff that tend to trend toward tiling window managers for some reason.
--- 92802919

I remember that. Even using their fonts on other distros doesn't compare. I still won't use Ubuntu again, but I have yet to see font rendering as good anywhere else.

I've been using Ubuntu for work the past few years but I want to make the complete switch away from Windows, primarily for privacy reasons. I have a similar distrust towards other big companies like Apple, Amazon etc.

This is a long term project for me that will involve "unhooking" myself from a lot of other services. 

Is Debian a decent distribution to go with if these are my concerns? I'd like something that is decently well supported with security updates and such but without corporations having their claws in it. For those reasons, I discarded Ubuntu and Fedora (my first two options).

Probably Fedora and SUSE because Ubuntu has always been the most performance retarded of the big 3 in general. If you're really hellbent on improving boot times you can get large gains from using a custom kernel and eliminating initrd from your early boot sequence.

Trying to do GPU passthrough with my shiny new NVIDIA GPU. Previously, I was running off AMD integrated graphics. 

When I first installed it and tried to boot, my computer hung in the boot jobs. Installing the nvidia drivers fixed this, meaning I could boot to NVIDIA or AMD depending on whether my GPU was plugged into the PSU.

OK, time to disable the GPU. Added 
>MODULES=(vfio_pci vfio_virqfd vfio vfio_iommu_type1)
to my mkinitcpio.conf (kernel linux515) (yes, modconf is in the hooks)
Added options vfio-pci ids=10de:2489,10de:228b to my vfio.conf 

System still hangs at 
::running early udev hooks
It seems to me that it's hanging at vfio. Not sure what the cause could be.

looks like you probably ran out of room on the device that was mounted there, or otherwise screwed up the filesystem. just un-tarring it shouldn't do anything, but you could try unmounting the drive and running fsck.ext4 /dev/sd(whatever).
>I am doing a first install thats the problem.

as long as it isn't your system device, sure.
parted works pretty well for me, since what you'd want to do is to remake the disk label (mklabel) and then some partitions (mkpart) with some sizes (300M, 16G, 100%, look up the syntax).
If that doesn't work, it's more likely a disk issue.

Yeah, that's normal. The guide isn't always up to date and it might not matter. Assuming it is and does matter: Press 'z' in menuconfig to see hidden items and scroll until you see "NVMe Target Support" select it and press '?'. Look at the the items in the "Visible if" and "Depends on" sections and enable them. Press '/' to search for symbols.

erm, so, i compiled the kernel now but forgot to emerge the microcode can i still do this after compiling the kernel?

AND, about nvidia drivers. It says on thexorg info page, that i can add the VIDEO_CARDS variable and set it to nvidia and then update the @world, and the its gonna get installed with. This means I will not need to install x11-drivers/
nvidia-drivers seperatly right?

--- 92820372
>>92820173
>forgot to emerge the microcode can i still do this after compiling the kernel?
Yeah, that's fine. The microcode gets loaded on boot, it doesn't need to be built into the kernel. 'sudo dmesg | grep microcode' after rebooting to verify.
>This means I will not need to install x11-drivers/nvidia-drivers seperatly [sic] right?
Correct
>And do I need to check the graphics support for nouvaeu?
If you built nouveau as a module you're fine. The nvidia-drivers package blacklists nouveau. I'd still recommend disabling it tho. If you built nouveau into your kernel you need to recompile your kernel with nouveau disabled or as a module.

btw, check out genkernel. It's nice desu.
--- 92820416
Why is systemd bad?
t. interested in gentoo
--- 92820531
>>92820416
It isn't bad per se. It's just much larger and more complicated than I need. Also the script-based services of openrc are more comfy to me than systemd's declarative services. If you're comfy in a shell then you might like it more.

You can still use systemd on Gentoo btw.

--- 92820779
>>92820372
Now what the hell exactly am i supposed to do here? i dont feel comfortable just copy pasting, what modules, why, which one should I pick?
--- 92820894
>>92820779
Just install the nvidia-drivers. The module for nouveau will be blacklisted by the package. You don't have to manually blacklist anything iirc. It just werks out of the box. Reboot and lsmod to see if nvidia or nouveau is being used.

If that was unsuccessful or if you want to disable nouveau for some other reason: go into menuconfig and press '/' to search. Type "nouveau" and press enter. "DRM_NOUVEAU" will be the first option. Press '1' to go to it from the search page. Press 'n' to exclude it. Then compile your kernel. EZ.
--- 92820936
>>92820894
i excluded novaeu according to https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/NVIDIA/nvidia-drivers
already, im still in installation so i cannot reboot now, i will install the nvidia drivers when i finished the installation and am in my gentoo machine directly.

so that means i can ignore the section in the pic?

Yeah, you got it. It depends on whether or not you need to force a module to load to make your hardware work. udev generally works tho.

--- 92821169
Does anyone know why my keyboard might alternate between 2 device names in /dev/input/by-id whenever my system goes to sleep? The 2 names are:
>usb-COMPANY_USB_Device-if02-event-kbd
>usb-COMPANY_USB_Device-event-kbd

Right after my system boots (or resumes from suspend) the device is the one without *-if02-* and then after about an hour it randomly switches to the if02 name.
It then stays like that until my system suspends again and it repeats the cycle.

Stop this. Bad way to learn. You wanna get cozy with linux you gotta get cozy with reading.

Instead:

- look up all the packages that make up coreutils and in your terminal type man $program$. Especially grep. Piping stiff into grep is a big deal.

- read through K&amp;R ANSI. You can skip the exercises but be sure to read the code segments and actually understand them. Unix &amp; C are very very very tight.

- do a vim tutorial. You don't have to memorize keybinds, just know what esc, i, :w, :wq, and :q do.

- journalctl -b 0 shows you the startup process for your system. Super helpful for when shit goes wrong. Don't read it all, just pgdn and scan it to get gut-familiarity.


Oh, also google 'linux journey'. That should probably come before you read K&amp;R. It's honestly an amazing introduction.

I created a subvolume `/@shared` which I want to mount to `/home/username/shared`. However, some problems arise:

1. `@shared` appears visibly in `/`. That isn't the case for any of the other subvolumes, which as far as I can tell have the same path structure, e.g. `/@home`.
2. Even after mounting it to /home via fstab, it doesn't seem to actually work. If I make changes in `/@shared`, they aren't visible or accessible via `/home/username/shared`.

Does linux (debian/ubuntu or mint ) play nice with amd gpus and or cpus or does linux prefer nvidia
--- 92824965
>>92824930
Linux prefers AMD CPUs/GPUs because of their open source drivers/kernel modules. NVIDIA cards work, but only if you use Xorg displays.
--- 92825021
>>92824930
Debian being all freetard doesn't provide firmware out of the box, you'll need firmware-amd-graphics but the driver code is in the kernel. But other than that AMD is more or less out of the box working. 
Nvidia on the other hand is next level harder as their driver code doesn't even exist in the kernel.

I think you have to mount the root filesystem first to make it (like in /mnt temporarily). I remember being confused by this too when adding a swap subvolume. I followed this guide: https://www.jwillikers.com/btrfs-swapfile (obviously ignore all the swap stuff)
--- 92825907
>>92824854
>appears visibly in `/`
What does this mean?
--- 92826038
>>92825907
Visibly as in a GUI. It actually shows up there. I point that out because the other subvolumes are also there yet they do NOT appear visibly.

>>92825843
When you say the root filesystem, do you mean the root directory, or the filesystem that the root directory exists on? I'll check out your guide in the meantime.
--- 92826079

I mean mounting the partition file, for example like this "mount /dev/sda1 /mnt" if your Btrfs filesystem is on /dev/sda1

-service units are great, beats scripting

-programs run by service units don't need logging capabilities as the output itself is logged

Is there something wrong with Mint? I fell in love with how correct the default install feels OOTB, but the fact that it's so far from Debian lingers in my mind. More specifically, I'm concerned about long term stability and security when used by a normal person.
I recall that Mint used to have this "pick repos you'd like to use" GUI thing, and it got called out on that because Ubuntu's security repositories weren't enabled by default. There was some commentary online on how Mint has a disregard for security thanks to that. However, in my fresh install of 21.1 I don't see that GUI tool to "enable optional security updates, but beware, they're unsafe (unstable/untested)", on the contrary: I got a popup suggesting I install security patches or enable automatic installing of them (I believe this is something like unattended-upgrades on Debian/Ubuntu), and in sources.list.d I had all repos enabled OOTB - Mint's, and then Ubuntu's including jammy-security, jammy-updates and jammy-backports.
Am I correctly understanding that Mint maintainers' stand on security updates has changed, and now they don't do any silly stuff I should beware? Like Manjaro delays Arch packages for 2 weeks, I consider this, well, retarded (pun intended).
Seriously, I love Mint as a go-to normie Linux distro so far. Is there something else I should know of before I deploy this on computers of family and friends who want to try Linux?
--- 92830108
>>92830034
No? Mint is basically just Ubuntu but with things tweaked and added with its own DE included.
--- 92830175

I'm aware, but you know, things can go very wrong when someone says "let's take this thing everyone knows and has many experienced people behind, and make our own based on that". cough, Manjaro, Garuda, etc. At least the shit added by Mint seems to work without issues, unlike the latter.
I recall that at one point Mint site was hacked and had backdoored ISOs, I'm a bit concerned about that as well. But I'm okay calling this a one time bad occurrence.
Anyway, hoping for comments from other anons as well.
