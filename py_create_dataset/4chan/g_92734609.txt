I want to replace my current vivobook with an actual good laptop, would prefer if it has great performance battery and display, also i want to be able to replace components since i will be using it for years to come.

i bought a W530 palmrest for my T530, complete with fingerprint reader and colorimeter
fingerprint works fine, but colorimeter wasnt picked up
turned out the T530 doesnt have the USB line needed for it to work
I wired in the 5V bus and the two USB lines (stolen from ExpressCard connector)
the colorimeter being picked up by lsusb now as Bus 002 Device 003: ID 0765:5010 X-Rite, Inc. X-Rite Pantone Color Sensor

when attempting to calibrate with displaycal i get the message dispcal: Error - new_disprd() failed with 'Instrument Access Failed'

how the shit do i calibrate my display anons
are there any anons with colorimeter equipped thinkpads that could verify if displaycal works

I'll never understand you Europeans, how you went from world conquerors to absolute knuckle dragging retards. Free university, but everyone is stupid, ironic.
There is no "Lenovo approved" IPS full HD panel to put in a T430, an immediate hack is necessary and Lenovo will never admit even tacit approval for such a thing. Subsequently, panels that Lenovo uses in their other offerings are in no way guaranteed to be better than any other company's. They may be, but writing that off as "Lenovo approved therefore best" is bewilderingly stupid.

And in the 6 hours that I've had it, I tore it apart, DIY'd a cmos battery replacement and replaced the fucking atrocious TN with a FHD IPS (from that ali seller >>92713947 →). And it actually is an IPS at least, but I've yet to confirm if it's a up-to-spec one. And it'll take a bit before I can confirm it's legit, because the preinstalled windowse 10 of course broke from that hardware change (pathethic), so now I'm the process of installing simplix'd win7 on it. Eventually I'll dualboot gentoo or freebsd on it, but for now I just need something that works and can run displaycal.

Oh and in case anyone was curious, the even the HD+ panel on these is just horrible. 60% sRGB coverage and 270:1 contrast.

Few measured specs below, manufacturer spec in quotes.
Brightness: 175 nits (300 nits)
sRGB coverage: ~100% (100%)
Contrast: 1250:1 (700:1)
White point: 7000K (6500K)
It also has perfect gamma tracking and sharpening behavior. No dead pixels, no backlight bleed, though it is an IPS so you always have IPS glow. No dead pixels (any you see in pic are from the camera, it's a 19 years old CCD).
Damn accurate out of the box, though white point just a bit cold. Easy to fix though, and with quick low-res calib best&amp;worst delta-e already is &lt;1.0. 
Just the brightness is not as high as it's supposed to be, but to put 175 nits in context, with good saturation its too bright for indoor use, outdoor it'll manage in a shade. So good enough. 
The contrast however is way beyond than what was advertised, and above average for IPS. Really surprised here. 
So this panel is basically perfect as far as IPS go. I have no idea if this is the real N140HCE-N1, but with this performance it doesn't matter. I now have a more accurate display in this 10 year old T430 than what the majority of anons have on their brand spaking new gayming desktops!

I actually had a Dell XPS 15 9550 like 2 years ago to replace the T400 but had to return it, QA on those things are fucking awful, and just returned to trusty T440. I do miss being able to play CIV VI on anything but strategic mode.

Back in one piece. The panel is not a perfect fit, like with Rev.C1 only either the top or bottom ears go in. And you must screw in the bottom ears, otherwise a dozen pixels will be cut off by the bezel on the top. 
Also cuts off half a pixel on the right side, but it's good enough. Maybe with bending and breaking shit enough it could be centered perfectly. 

>>92749754
Decided to quit the board, but sharing this T430 and info on the panel mod is worthy of making an exception. 

>>92751969
90€ + 10€ shipping. 
This variant had a i5-3320M, no dGPU, 4GB ram, 128GB SSD, HD+ 900p TN and a non-backlight nordic keyboard.
I think in this condition with that SSD, it's a very reasonable price. I had a spare 8GB stick around too, so ram isn't a problem immediately. 
Though all reasonableness goes out the window when considering the cost of modding. The IPS mod alone adds another 150€, though I can sell the original HD+ display for ~40€ hopefully. 

I think I found a seller of refurb 45N2211 7-row keyboards. We'll find out in a month. This T430 will be so sexy if the item is legitimate. I WILL beat >>92753344.

Thank god they don't put fluoride in the water here, might have grown up as retarded as you. 
Trading the excessive outdoor brightness for so much superior contrast is an amazing deal. I use my monitors at 60-120 nits, anything above that is painful to look at indoors and is reserved strictly for outdoor use. 
>doesn't fit
I knew it wouldn't be perfect, known "issue" with this mod. The half a pixel of obstruction can hardly be seen in practice. 

If you can recommend a better panel that can be made fits a T430, go ahead. Show me what other panel can deliver 1250:1 contrast.

Biggest drawback is the lack of quad-core CPU configurations, and that alone may make the X280 the better option but it really depends on your use case because that model lacks the battery bridge system and has fewer ports (non-standard Ethernet, microSD instead of SD).

How much CPU performance can I gain from upgrading my X220 to T480?

>>92782259
I use an X270 because I'm not so bothered by shoddy speakers. For your use I would still probably recommend the X1 Carbon (Gen 7 was even the exact model I used to have).
Sure soldered RAM stinks, but in all reality it is more and more becoming the norm. The way I see it, your options are:
>accept soldered RAM and get a semi-modern laptop like the X1C7
>accept shitty speaker quality and use an older laptop that fits the rest of your specs
>pay an exorbitant amount for either a new and shiny laptop like the X1C9 or a meme laptop like Framework (which even then may not have good speakers)
At the end of the day, do you REALLY need more than 16gb of RAM, especially if you will be using Linux and not Winblows? Obviously it depends on your DE as well as your use case, but running Debian with Openbox I rarely use more than 4gb of my 16gb of RAM. As far as I'm concerned, any more is only really useful for gaming or rendering.

Is it worth buying a ThinkPad at this price? The biggest drawback is that it's refurbished.

Alternatively, I could get a brand new HP laptop (AMD Athlon Gold 3150U, 8 GB DDR4 2400 MHz SDRAM, 256 GB M.2 SSD) for 324 EUR. I never bought a refurbished laptop before so I don't know how bad the consequences can be.

My X260 had been refurbished and it began suffering from unidentifiable hardware failures a few months into using it, this was 4 years ago and I've put up with it until now.
I opened it up once and there was shit stuck in place with tape, so I suspect when they say refurbished they just mean getting it functional enough for it to be sold as working.
--- 92796462
>>92796061
Well the l9600 is rarer to find than the lower spec models, so it's not factored into the averages as much, which iirc is $160 for the x200s according to the guide. This one is also in very good condition, it was the best of what was available when i searched. My laptop right now is literally being held together by duct tape, so i just went with it.

First of all, thank you for answering. Can you give me a subjective comparison of sound of X1C7 vs X270? Is it really that much better like Notebookcheck says? "very good" they said. At least they also said T480s sounds awful.
I think I'll buy some cheapest X1C7 to just check it myself and return, then hunt for a best specced model. X1C9 looks (well, looks) nicer than 7 with all speakers on top instead of top/bottom mix, and could get up to 32GB, but it's just really expensive, more than I think I'd like to spend on laptop (despite it being my main computer). On the other hand, if it really was an excellent machine, I think I could be fine with the increased cost. I have a rule that buying older flagship phone makes more sense than buying cheap midrange from current year. Maybe buying a premium laptop for premium price would be just as smart.
I just have to absolutely make sure it's indeed a premium laptop. Lack of Ethernet (even the foldable latch kind), and that soldered RAM makes me feel otherwise. Are there other thinkpads with remarkably "not as shitty as usual" sound? I don't need laptop to be super thin or light. Those compromises above seem like direct consequences of that.
>Framework
Speakers are so-so according to internet, still better than T480s but I would also lose the mouse buttons above touchpad.
>do I need more than 16GB
Not really, but if I'm going to spend so much, I'd rather have more than I need especially if this laptop is going to stay with me for a few years. If the speakers were good in T480s, I'd keep it for a few more years - works well, is sturdy, etc.

I feel sad when I notice Apple shills/users (how can you even tell...) have it easy nowadays - spend some money and get good laptop, spend more and get even better laptop. I have to fucking compromise on my requirements. But I love Linux, those trackpoint buttons and Thinkpad keyboard. Even if Asahi got production ready, I really can't imagine myself using a no-button touchpad.
--- 92797993
>>92797844
>X1C9 looks (well, looks) nicer than 7 with all speakers on top instead of top/bottom mix
I'm blind, it has bottom speakers as well. Anyway, doesn't matter, just noticed that those side grills look pretty. 16:10 obviously would be good to have but that alone wouldn't warrant a 100% price increase vs gen 7 offers that I'm seeing.

Did you buy it from Lenovo or from some eBay seller? I've found that eBay refurbs are almost invariably garbage. My most recent and last purchase was a Sony Blu-Ray player that would intermittently freeze on playback. Got my money back on that one, bought a brand new one in store, have had zero issues since. But I've also bought a T480 from the "Lenovo Outlet" (ie, refurbished store) and it had all kinds of issues, was barely functional, and crashed constantly. Ended up returning it and buying a new X395 (which also ended up having a ton of hardware issues, just less annoying).

>>92797844
X270 is at least a bit better than say the older X220/X230, but beyond that I can't give much of a benchmark. I highly doubt it'll be sufficient if you're an audiophile, and I can't imagine it's much better than (if it's not the exact same configuration as) the T480s.
I personally don't have too much experience with modern laptops, though I do remember thinking the X1C7 sounded surprisingly good. Probably the best I've heard barring a MacBook; say what you will about Apple, but the audiovisual aspects of their hardware are killer. Same goes for the screen on the Carbon; pretty good. Not sure what changes were made between the gen 7 and gen 9.

>>92801363
One thing to know about the T440p is that the default trackpad is turbo-kusoge tier. Even if you're a nipple user, it lacks separate right/left click buttons so the experience for that is shit as well. So you should really include the price of a new trackpad in the equation as well.
Not only that, but 4gb of RAM won't take you far, and you're going to want to upgrade to a quad-core CPU (after all, that's one of the reasons to get a T440p in the first place). AND you'll need a disk, assuming you don't have one on hand.
So post a new estimate with all that accounted for and ask again. Chances are, though; no, it is not a good deal. Because at that point you could get a T480 for a similar cost and have similar performance but with FAR better battery life and thermals.
--- 92802909
>>92765451
I have a P52 and it definitely requires some work. Repasting is annoying since you need to disensemble the entire fucking thing to get to the CPU. Also, undervolting and setting up core limits with throttle stop is a must. otherwise it will be throttling and giving you inconsistent performance under stress.

That being said. If you're ok with some initial screwing around you'll have a really nice, powerful machine that performs well under load. I actually use it for [spoiler]gaming[/spoiler] without issues.

>>92748876
>700:1
Actually, the panel is performing as expected. The 700:1 stated contrast is some strange 0-63 value, not 0-255 like we'd assume. 
3rd party reviews of laptops with this N140HCE-EN1 panel also get >1100:1 contrast. So I can confidently say that this is the real panel. 
The brightness is still odd, could it be due to the adapter board? Regardless, it's more than bright enough still for my use.

Thanks again anon. I ordered an 8GB X1C7 (I can't believe how stupid that sounds, RAM memory being something you need to decide at computer purchase time...) and will check the sound situation myself, then return. I'm not an audio expert, but T480s just is too quiet to be decent. I got used to the sound signature (near 0 lows, but otherwise decent mids and highs) but I'm interested in improving volume and lows since sister will probably want to take my T480s as a college PC. Battery is still in good shape, i7 and 24GB of RAM will be plenty for her.
It sounds really fucking stupid that I'll probably have to downgrade to 16 GB to receive a laptop with better speakers. Why not put some effort into audio in Txx models? You already did that for X1Cx.

Yeah when I watched a comparison between some Apple laptop and X1 Extreme G3/G4 iirc, the latter didn't stand a chance. I was disheartened at that point.

I'm not the anons who replied to you before. I would consider this work laptop very "managed" then, and talk with the IT staff beforehand instead of silently using your own machine which they'll see as suspicious. Let them know that using Windows is fucking atrocious for dev work, and if they're concerned about compliance, they can use e.g. FleetDM to ensure auditors that everyone has full disk encryption and some antivirus running. That's what my company does, each dev can run whatever software stack they decide is most productive, but they have to run a small opensource agent that checks security policy compliance to cover CTO ass when someone wants to audit us.
I know what you feel, and I know I'm lucky to be in a company who understands that devs aren't necessarily retarded. Make IT in your company know that Windows or whatever hurts your productivity, and ask why it's enforced you have Adobe/Autodesk DRM running when you don't use it at all. And let them know about alternatives that will give you and them a compromise.

Can anyone id the stinkpad? Guy is selling all these piece of shit laptops for 30 bucks, who knows I can get the thinkpad for a fiver.

Looks like an X220, but the fingerprint reader location is off
--- 92837837
>>92837739
replying to myself, I've tried some google image searches and a T400 looks pretty spot on, judging from the three silver buttons on the top left of the keyboard and the fingerprint reader location.

Both are completely different beasts. 
>T430 = larger, uses more power/generates a lot of heat, extremely modular, cheaper, classic lenovo thinkpad design, can be librebooted, with a 4 core i7 it holds up pretty well
>T480 = comparably smaller, uses less power/generates less heat, not nearly as modular, more expensive, nu-lenovo design, cannot be librebooted, holds up well
I'd pick the T430 every time desu. But I do own a heavily modded X230 (keyboard, screen, BIOS, RAM, WiFi card, storage, all non-stock components. Not something you can do with a T480).
--- 92839826
>>92839736
I take back the T480 not being modular, I was mistaken. I really meant to say that there was not as much aftermarket support for the T480 as older ThinkPads.

>Latitude C610
>Thinkpad T400

Shit, my high school and university computers

The C610 was actually pretty based. Mine had an SXGA+ screen (1400x1050), a Mobility Radeon graphics card, and the keyboard was actually mechanical. It used very compact linear switches. Personally I preferred the keyboard on that to the T400, and it's among the best laptop keyboards I've ever used.

>>92840103
I had a Gen 3 T14 and I had a lot of problems with it. The build quality was not up to the standards of the xx40 generation Thinkpads (and certainly not up to the standards of earlier models), it thermal throttled like a bitch, overall thermals were terrible and my CPU would randomly idle at 80c, and the drivers were buggy, I sometimes got issues with the Trackpoint or graphics after waking from sleep. I had been using a 16" 2019 Macbook Pro at work, and I do not exaggerate when I say that laptop had better thermal performance than the Thinkpad. Last month my company offered to let me buy out the Mac for $400, which was a really good deal, so now that's my main machine. No idea what I'm going to do with the T14, maybe sell it (at a heavy loss of course, because Thinkpad).

Is redmibook okay in this thread?
If not, I'd just ask general question, do you use your laptop always plugged in or charge -> use -> charge?
It was quite a shock upgrading from my ancient 2008 ASUS to Redmibook 15, which doesn't have removable batteries.

T450 or X250, anyways, if you can make it work, its an amazing deal. You'll probably have to put in new ssd, a new battery and some ram. New keyboard and screen if they don't work / look good. You can spend between 20 and 100 more bux and make it your daily driver. Amazing buy.

Was Lenovo T510 the last of the great laptops of old era?

>15.6" is too big

You are just wrong, this is the perfect size.
T410 has, due to its smaller size (14"), inadequate cooling. X201 is even smaller but has identical cooling to T410. You may ask why? It's because X201 has no space for DVD drive while T410 has a DVD drive. They balance out and now both have bad cooling for CPU.

But T510 just doesnt have any of the problems above. How about screen then? Anything with lower resolution than 1920x1080 is shit. But the full HD screen is super magnificent in T510 its the best there ever was in Lenovos.

Can we find anything bad about it? Well yeah you need to avoid the one with Nvidia. You need to buy the intel version. It CANNOT have core-i7 CPU because i7 in a laptop will only work with Nvidia GPUs. So you need to put up with core-i5.

You can use 8GB RAM and surfa a Linux internet like a pro, with T510 that has Intel GPU, 2,4GHz dual core i5 (1st generation) and it will never over heat, ever.

With a 10 year old bad battery you can still surf for 2 hours. With a retrofitted nice and shiny battery you can surf for 6 hours. These machines wont be checking if your battery is legit, they accept any kind of battery if its physically fits and has the right electrical properties, no shenanigans with ID chips that probe out if you have a legit Lenovo battery.

The Linux support for integrated 3G modem is phenomenal. So is for Intel WIFI from the year 2010. Too bad 3G is quite useless now as a tech.

posting from my stock opensuse tumbleweed x60s.

I like it but never really get to use it too much. Got a 2014 11" MBA for studies and a P51s for light gaymen.

Also considering going from opensuse to debian and librebooting it, only issue is i have no free as in freedom wifi card so going to have to use proprietary wifi drivers for it.
--- 92847082
>>92846871
if you are considering t510, there is no reason not to get t520 instead. they only differ in internals and sandy bridge is much faster than westmere. t520 also has quad-core configurations and qual-core models can be upgraded to a quad-core, which you cannot do with a t510.
>Can we find anything bad about it? Well yeah you need to avoid the one with Nvidia. You need to buy the intel version. It CANNOT have core-i7 CPU because i7 in a laptop will only work with Nvidia GPUs. So you need to put up with core-i5.
the ability to turn off the nvidia gpu and only use intel was added in one of the bios updates iirc. even the nvidia models have fully functional intel gpus because they are located on the cpu package. t520 had that option from the beginning. another reason to get t520, really.
--- 92847619
>>92846871
>>92847082
Why not a modded T430? One without the nvidia gpu can handle the 45W i7's, probably beating a maxed out T510 at least. 
You can mod in the classic keyboard and a very high quality FHD IPS (or even 1440p one if you're crazy) on it too.

So I set my battery charge threshold to 70/80 for both BAT0 and BAT1 (with TLP), is it possible to set the value for when to swap the batteries discharging when under a threshold? I think by default is goes down to 5%, is that even bad for battery life? If so I'd like to change it to around 20%.

Which one should I get anons, and why?
--- 92852442
The only Thinkpad model I've used and/or taken apart is T460. I thought that one was pretty nice and easy to disassemble. I'm thinking of getting a T470, T480, X270 or P50. Can anybody comment on the build quality, reliability, ease of upgrade/repair, battery life, and speaker quality on these ones? I heard that they added some clips that make them hard to take apart on the new models and each new model has other issues as well.

Is there anyone here using t420 ? I found one for 50€ and thinking about buying it. While searching I saw some people saying it is not strong enough in 2023 and how they bought new one instead. I need it for web browsing watching video and university assignments
--- 92858035
>>92857857
idk if a lot of ppl here use t420 specifically but its basically in the same ballpark as all our x220, x230, t430:s

which are all completely fine in my personal experience, especially when running linux. windows is fine, just be careful with bloat, but not preferred if you dont absolutely need some program

since its a 50 euro deal just make sure to upgrade to an SSD and at least 8 gigs of ram if it doesnt have those already
--- 92858468
>>92852991
no, they have notoriously horrible screens. they're business laptops, meaning durability/modularity/reliability, everything else be damned. You can get an IPS mod though to make them better

Will a Intel Core i5-1235U with Intel Iris Xe "Gen 12.2" graphics have hardware accelerated AV1 decode?
