Technically yes, because NDEs are real and prove that there is an afterlife and that we are eternal and will go to heaven unconditionally when we die. And they say not only music, but everything else in heaven is more than billions of times better in heaven than here. Oh, and music is free in heaven too.

>b-b-but NDEs are dreams or hallucinations somehow!!!!!!1!
Already refuted in the literature you likely have not read on NDEs.

Here is a very persuasive argument for why NDEs are real:

https://youtu.be/U00ibBGZp7o [Embed]

It emphasizes that NDErs are representative of the population as a whole, and when people go deep into the NDE, they all become convinced. As this article points out:

https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/mysteries-consciousness/202204/does-afterlife-obviously-exist 

>"Among those with the deepest experiences 100 percent came away agreeing with the statement, "An afterlife definitely exists"."

Since NDErs are representative of the population as a whole, and they are all convinced, then 100% of the population become convinced that there is an afterlife when they have a sufficiently deep NDE themselves. When you dream and wake up, you instantly realize that life is more real than your dreams. When you have an NDE, the same thing is happening, but on a higher level, as you immediately realize that life is the deep dream and the NDE world is the undeniably real world by comparison.

Or as one person quoted in pic related summarized their NDE:

>"I could see and feel an even brighter light pulling me toward it, and as it shined on me, I felt indescribable happiness. I remembered everything about eternity - knowing, that we had always existed, and that all of us are family. Then old friends and loved ones surrounded me, and I knew without a doubt I was home, and that I was so loved."

Needless to say, even ultraskeptical neuroscientists are convinced by really deep NDEs. As are hardcore atheist programmers.

Only good thing about spotify is it's doing pretty good job making playlists. And when listening to songs "on repeat" it's not random playlist, it plays songs more often that you listen more.
But all this can be solved by not being lazy fuck.
Also, it's quality sounds like shit. I don't know why, even after making it play highest quality, it's still worse than mp3.
--- 92803269
Tidal is alright, way better sound quality than Spotify has. Playlists and suggestions are pretty bad though.

pay to listen only makes sense if you're a ADHD zoomer who constantly needs new 2 minute 20 second songs to listen to because your brain is completely fried and you have no taste or concept of actual good music made by artists.

Both. Sometimes I try the "add to playlist" thing and the enhance playlist button to see if it suggests anything interesting. Do you use the little button on the discovery weekly songs that tells spotify not to suggest stuff like that?
>discover weekly is so weird. it worked amazing for me until 2020 
Me too but 2021 or 2022. Sometimes it gives me some good songs, then sometimes all of them suck and are nothing like what I listen to. I don't know if it's because I've rejected so many suggestions already or because they changed something important.
>then for 2 years it exclusively had meditation/sleep aid music for me, looked up and apparently it was a common unresolved issue
That's a really weird issue, a lot of my friends use it and I've never heard of this.

I used to be a huge local media guy, had a massive collection of music all perfectly cataloged, huge lossless collection, several ipods/various mp3 players, etc. But spotify honestly is ridiculously convenient and with it and youtube, I never download songs anymore. I get spotify for free with my debit card which helps a lot, idk if I'd pay for it.

I feel like I need to go off the deep end and set up a fuck huge home server, I still have a massive desire to amass and catalog media
--- 92817447
>>92817362
Me too. I was editing the info for every song I ripped from the internet, giving them cover art etc. but Spotify just streamlines all of that at the expense of a subscription and a meh UI. 
Plus being able to sync between devices, control my PC speakers from my phone, letting friends queue any songs from their phones, it's extremely convenient.

I refuse to pay for Spotify because nothing I listen to is available there in the US. Same for Apple Music. I know other countries have it, but it is region-locked for no reason. Bandcamp is the best legal option I know, but it is still missing so much.
/yarhar/ is there, of course. I have a pretty decent music collection that I've collected from private trackers, Soulseek, and ytdl rips. Although, I haven't come up with a good, non-intrusive way to get it through to my phone, so there it is literally manual Invidious searching lmao. Perhaps I'll do Syncthing eventually, since we are just talking 5GB of FLACs.
Honestly, so much innovation could happen here, and I'd happily pay monthly for a service that just... indexed EVERYTHING I could possibly want in highest available quality, from all services where tracks could be found, and all sources possible, worldwide but I know that the music industry is a fucking mafia that would never let such a thing fly without trillions yearly in bullshit royalties.

Stealing MP3s is if you have unlimited time. I don't so I use spotify.

I listened to ryoji ikeda once, now I don't need to listen to music anymore, when I hear a noise my head automatically turns it into music

literally anything is better than Spotify it is one of the only services that don't give lossless audio to premium users

Convenience and an algorithm that helps you find more music. Also, at this point downloading is the wierd thing.

> I have a pretty decent music collection that I've collected from private trackers, Soulseek, and ytdl rips. Although, I haven't come up with a good, non-intrusive way to get it through to my phone, so there it is literally manual Invidious searching lmao. Perhaps I'll do Syncthing eventually, since we are just talking 5GB of FLACs.

PlexAmp?

You guys do realize that places like soulseek have a ton fake FLACs, right? You're literally no different from a streamfag who listens to his music at 320kbps, in fact, the streamfag probably has a better experience than you because only god knows what bitrate those fake FLACs were encoded at.

I download all my music off YouTube and play it with mpv. Works for me. Here is a picture of a funny dog I found.

>lets say it died tomorrow, or your internet was shut down.
That would be catastrophic, I don't think I'd be listening to music if this happens. Shit would be insane
