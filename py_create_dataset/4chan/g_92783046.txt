iirc the amplesound acoustic guitar is about as good as it gets, but I haven't checked out any instrument libraries in a while. I've been hearing good things about decentsampler. The libraries for it all seem to be on a seperate site called pianobooks for some reason. Maybe you'll find a decent acoustic library there.

>>92784091
Agreed, the midi guitar experience is really different from a real guitar. I think it stems from the midi protocol being based off of keyboard instruments. The way you approach playing and managing notes on a guitar fretboard is different enough that midi can't recreate it realistically. Since I learned to play the guitar, I haven't bothered sequencing any guitar parts.

Be prepared to read the manual before you can do anything, it's like 250 pages long. It's a based drum machine though, you have a lot of editing possibilities. You can hear it used with the default drums on tons of songs. /ourgirl/ used it in a good portion of her work and the default kit is clearly audible in quite a few songs.

As long as you set the IDs of your HDDs correctly it should be alright. Don't forget to use a terminator after the last unit on the bus. Terminator problems and ID conflicts are the main sources of issue with SCSI.

Yep it was popular because it was so much more flexible than typical drum machines. But it requires a trained operator, anybody can learn how to use a TR-series or clone pretty quickly but you'll never get the weird time signatures and other features the R8 gives you with anything like that.

Frankly you're using the wrong tools - if you want to create DnB, you need to get an MPC. Simple as. Ableton can easily trigger samples though, that's like basics 101. Watch a video or read the manual.

My mixing is so garbage anons, that I can barely tolerate hearing my own music anymore.

--- 92810505
>>92808806
>>get feedback from people.
>>listen the mix on as much devices as possible
>What else should I do?
those two suggestions above and try not to be too critical. making the music is the easy part but getting it all to be mixed in and playing well together is a separate art form that takes practice. one thing i would suggest is finding a bunch of music similar to what you're making that's been properly mastered and use those tracks as a reference. from that you can get ideas of how loud or quiet certain things need to be, use of effects, compression, the eq of certain sounds etc. because even if your speakers and whatever isn't the greatest you can still get very close to having a mix that sound goods on everything.
--- 92810700
>>92810333
GPU audio replaces the need for external DSP so you can run the same amount of processing (actually way more) on a laptop, lets you run huge projects full of plugins without having to bounce (even if they run flawlessly, when do you ever just run one?) and lets developers make VSTs that do DSP-intensive tasks (such as the spatial convolution in that library) without having to build for hardware (which is prohibitive for many, if not most developers).
You may not have a need for it, but many others do. If you do any serious sound design you probably find yourself making huge patches that max out your CPU (lots of voices, layering, processes that are intrinsically expensive, etc) pretty often, and plugins built on this technology would solve that almost completely.

Seeeee the thiiiiing is

Can you wing it, not really pay attention, and then put a hard clipper or limiter at the end of your chain and have it work? Definitely. The result of it actually sounding good won’t be easily replicate though, and you may have problems arise that are difficult to identify/rectify (Note: it’s much easier to get away with poor practice in formulaic music where it’s “wrong” the same way every time (trap comes to mind))

The reason why managing your gain throughout, (and compression/clipping) is both to maximize the amount of control you have, to make things easier on yourself (making mixing decisions at equivalent volumes is very important ) and to mitigate accidents (e.g one plugin is adding a shit lot of gain or distortion somewhere, or eating headroom from the last point of compression and it effects the tone of the whole buss (again, we want things to be reppicatable where you know exactly what’s happening).

It’s *much* better practice to know where everything is peaking, and be able to identify “oh my kick is peaking x dB over everything else and that’s what the limiter is reacting to for x dB gain reduction at this point (so on...)” than to just leave everything at unity and slam at the end praying for a good result.

This all isn’t even getting into the subject of headroom for your mixes/master- you’re shooting yourself in the foot if you don’t at least semi-pay attention to gain staging.

>and lets developers make VSTs that do DSP-intensive tasks
people with very expensive CPUs and many gb of RAM don't have this problem with VSTs without any co-processor. since the absolute state of plugins in current year with some developers is bad without co-processor i highly doubt it'll improve the software with a co-processor. add copy protection and i think the performance savings quickly evaporate.

Wrong. Bouncing and reducing quality settings are still common with powerful processors because the projects some times scale accordingly.
And besides, not everyone has or wants a huge workstation. Your whole argument hinges on a very narrow idea of what a professional is. Lots of people who work with audio work with laptops on the go, or simply don't have the studios and hardware that are more common in the mixing/mastering side of audio production.
The vast majority of electronic music producers (including pop and hip-hop ones) work on laptops. Are they not professionals as well?

>>92810973
>since the absolute state of plugins in current year with some developers is bad without co-processor i highly doubt it'll improve the software with a co-processor. add copy protection and i think the performance
This is binary thinking. A plugin can be heavy on the CPU for a number of different reasons. Some of them are indeed because the developers are so bad that they can't make something efficient AND they wouldn't be able to make their plugins run on the GPU, but in every other case this doesn't apply. They can be inefficient because the specific process they're coding is just very expensive (like convolution, additive synthesis, "spectral" processes, anything that requires lots of things running in parallel, etc) or it's simply harder to optimize than it is to offload to the GPU.
And this whole thing is moot, because if GPU audio becomes common, chances are that eventually there will be companies that make a GPU-based alternative to the slower CPU-based version (regardless of why it's slow).

>add copy protection and i think the performance savings quickly evaporate.
Completely retarded statement. Audio on the GPU lets you run orders of magnitude more DSP, and to think that the marginal hit in performance brought by copy protection would make a dent is hilarious.

>hardware exists. has existed for decades in various forms. DSP is everywhere in a pro's studio
Again, not every pro has or wants hardware (read above for why this "no true Scotsman" is wrong), and even if that was the case, there are simply many plugins that don't run on hardware.
Sure, if you want something like the Eventide effects, or the Kyma, or whatever runs on UAD cards, you have your based covered. But what if you want something that doesn't have an alternative that runs on hardware? The most popular or powerful synths don't, for example. Most of the effects used in experimental sound design don't. Things like the spatial library above don't.
The list goes on and on.
You may not care about those, but it's undeniable that a lot of people do.

>i don't see musicians rushing to the shops to get a top of the line nvidia card just to run VST plugins. not going to happen. the market is limited
Your prediction is worth less than zero, as you've proven yourself to have no understanding of anything involved.
Besides, people running assembled desktops will buy it like they buy the powerful components they already have in, and the rest will just use the integrated graphics that their Macs already have.

>as i mentioned above, people with decent CPUs and systems don't have this problem
As I mentioned above, you're wrong for several reasons.

Anyway, considering the utter stupidity of your posts, you're either trolling or you're a bitter retard. In either case you're not worth the time and I won't be wasting any more arguing against your fallacies and incorrect statements. Bye.

I'm thinking of watching one of those start-to-finish courses where an artist talks about every aspect of a song they make and things like that. Maybe it would help freshen up my things since everything's getting a bit samey.

Bro I was soooo hyped to see one of his available projects to download was with my patron saint (qebrus) (rip fuck man) and all of the actual good shit (I.e everything that wasn’t mr. bills) was just printed audio and I’m SO fucking mad about it what fucking bullshit is that man FUCK. If I had actually payed I would have asked for a refund.

Literally the only good thing to come of it was getting clues in that a lot of the sounds I heard was definitely made kilohearts shit since producers like that obviously get all buddy-buddy and share their super secret tricks and I ended up being able to reverse engineer some specific sounds after grinding for XP for like a year.... iirc it wasn’t even in the session, it just made me aware that they actually worked together.

>>92826929
It wasn't anything worth talking about- either there were basic patches or printed files with plugin names, or Mr. Bill had mentioned those plugins specifically and I connected the dots.

They're obviously good plugins for their main purpose but once you start pushing things into glitch territory the difference can be significant- not in an objectively better sounding way but a *specific sound* way. I *strongly suspected* for a long time until I got exact sounds like... last week while systematically running an idea I had and just happened to nail one.... so I'm *pretty sure* now.
... the only other thing I knoooow know (heard so don't know) is that he used logic (actually that would partially explain the Mr. Bill project thing, huh), and that people have said he fucked with coding etc, which wouldn't be surprising, but also wouldn't be surprising if it was completely made up because people say that shit about every marginally IDM sounding producer and how to get similar sounds lol.

--- 92835696
>>92833440
It depends on your needs. You can use more gear with MIDI than you can with USB since it took USB almost 20 years after the introduction of MIDI to appear on musical instruments, the cable length limit isn't nearly as short as USB, and historically there were less timing issue with MIDI than USB (I don't know if it's still the case though).

>making my own multi-samples has been fun. for whatever reason whenever i make my own samples, i get more into whatever song i'm making
>ever since i bought a decent mic, i've been adding vocals on basically everything i make. sometimes this forces me to develop ideas more, but on the con side i feel like i settle too early with vocal melodies and also i sometimes hate my voice
>i want a tube drum machine. maybe i'll make one out of metasonix modules some day. someone has a d-1000 on reverb for $5.5k - fuck that. just get a couple of their bandpass filters VCAs and make it work
>i forced myself to write today even though i wasn't in the mood. the results were okay. i wrote a song that's basically a joy division rip off and i'll probably scrap it but the instrumental sounds kind of warm and nice
--- 92838324
Has anyone here used BandLab on their phone? 
I'm having a lot of fun with it, but I'm not sure if there's any hidden licensing stuff that'll get me later if I publish tracks made with this software and its instruments.
--- 92838532
>>92838306
Same. I re-use everything I make from scratch at some point but building up a whole instrument just gets you so much more invested.

>settle too early
Same, it's a real problem.
The only ways I've found to combat this are to make the early stages of songwriting largely based around brain storming parts (not really vocal exclusive obvs) for every instrument both vertically and horizontally so to speak (i.e both what accompanies it (arrangement) and what comes next)= those parts end up getting mixed around a lot.
Also learning to be comfortable with throwing ideas out completely is necessary to make room for better ideas.

Write everyday! Getting good isn't based off how you feel, it's just a habit bb.

so how do I realize I'm making shit while I'm making it? although not having an overly strict "internal censorship" can help with creativity sometimes I guess, if I instead just deleted every idea as not being good enough and ended up with nothing then that would be worse

impossible for a beginner, comes with years and years of practice. even then, the best judge of your own work is you in 2 weeks.
for now, just focus on creating and building your internal critic in parallel (educating yourself in music theory, wide variety of musical styles etc)
>https://voca.ro/15H1EXMm9gNR
idk what you were going for here really, but the main melody cant hold listeners attention for longer than 10 seconds, it might be a good bass line rather. the filter envelope also gets heavy on the ear in a while
--- 92854922
>>92854671
>overly strict "internal censorship"
It’s critical to not *during* writing for sure, but recognizing bad song ideas quickly is something most people are naturally terrible and only learn through experience ime.
For me, it usually comes down to if I can immediately see where it’s going, and or if a part actually makes me want to dance/headbang etc or has a melody I can actually remember after twenty minutes (or better, the next day) of not working on something (I know that doesn’t sound like a long time but if I just layed down 5~ potential parts in MIDI I’m probably not going to have them memorized right away).

Most ideas don’t make it past 10-20 minutes for me, you have to be willing to kill off ideas immediately.
This is also largely a taste/golden ear thing, which I think is weirdly ignored even though it’s like the single most important asset of a musician lol
--- 92855018
>>92854671
>so how do I realize I'm making shit while I'm making it?

Well, you've already uncovered one way. Next time you're excited about something, get away from it for some time and then revisit with earbuds in a different context. 

Usually revisiting in general is how I organize and sus out timewaster ideas. It's probably good to go through your ideas/WIP folder once every two weeks or whatever and cull the nonsense. You don't have to be overly critical. If you think something has a hint of a good idea, you can move it to a "needs to be reworked" folder or something similar.

in my opinion it's best not to think about it too much while you're in the zone and actually enjoy making it, but then make a break, listen to some other stuff and listen to what you've done after a while
if it's still good then great, polish it a little, then give it some time again to see if you still like it, only then i would show it to anyone else
if you're not feeling it when you try to listen to it after some breaks a few times just leave it or delete it, it would probably happen a lot but such is life

>why?
Idk, there's just a certain sound I'm chasing where the sound/resonance begins to break a little that seems most common with valves. 

>also why not get a normal analogue drum machine and slap a tube distortion on it?

It's just a matter of control and options, I guess. If I put together like a 60HP rack of tube bandpass filters and VCAs I could use that to both generate drum sounds (bc the filters oscillate) and process external drum sounds. Any tube distortions you recommend? I've been messing around with some Metasonix emulations in the reaktor user library with decent results

Nta but whenever I need that sound I just use dynamic tube in ableton lol.
Plenty of airwindows distortions go into interesting territory like that as well.
Fabfilter Saturn has a “broken” option under tubes but imo that one and Saturn in general don’t really have that much space between very subtle and completely distorted, but maybe that’s what you want.

Project folder naming convention idea #37:
>YYMM## 
>YY00## reserved for asset production like sound design, custom breakbeats, etc -- things entirely intended to be used in other projects
Thoughts?
--- 92862984
Why do you think juke/footwork never got *extremely* popular?

The most mainstream person producer in the sphere of what I pay attention to is Machine Girl, and obviously the producers they've directly inspired are more about jungle; in fact almost all of what I hear from the past 5~ years are primarily DnB/jungle producers who only *dabble* in footwork.
I don't consider myself very in tune with dance music trends in general but I'm only aware of big songs that launched careers like 10~ years ago of producers who ended up quickly moving on (one name in particular comes to mind as a prime example but I can't remember her name).

Is it not conducive to elements people who aren't into dance music find catchy (melodically, primarily).
Are the rhythms too complex for normies and or is the barrier to entry for producers to high (i.e it's a little harder to just loop spam compared to house or dnb etc).

>YYMM##
personally I quickly abandoned this when I realized it doesn't help me find projects, and it stops making sense as soon as you revisit a project, in which case you start adding revisions within that folder (so the date no longer makes sense) or you re-save the project under a new date, and folders begin to get scattered and you start storing duplicate files

For sound design, I just do Year-month but it depends on how you work.
If it's something you do daily, that'll end up being a long list, but if it's less often and you re-use those particular assets *a lot* then maybe it makes sense for you.

it was decently popular on soundcloud during mid 2010s, but i think it isn't known much in general since the house scene in Chicago happened at the same time and overshadowed it
house turned into piano house/vocal house in the 90s and was played on the radio everywhere, true deep house/footwork didn't get much air at all and remained in select labels
--- 92863393
>>92862984
>juke/footwork
that music was popular in chicago because of local scenes and the producers that drove the local scenes. a lot of them were dancers when they were younger and made music for dancers when they got old. you would need that kind of generational development in other places.
--- 92863402
>>92862984
I don't know.. I was into it; it felt like a fresh modern take on 90s rave music. I felt that DJ Paypal got pretty big.. Machinedrum's Vapor City had some solid footwork/juke vibes.

Nice link; I'm going to have to listen to his set during my next exercise session.

>>92863072
>personally I quickly abandoned this when I realized it doesn't help me find projects,
That's what Obsidian is for ;)
It's not necessarily the date, but the month when you first started the project to help at least give a broad grouping since I find taste/style is always evolving and broad time periods could give hints as to what type of sound you were making at that time. I could probably just get away with YY###.

Another thought I had was to group projects by an opus number to keep projects of similar style, intent, and time period grouped together.
I wonder.. did classical composers assign opus numbers and piece numbers after pieces were completed, or when they were started?
I imagine they're all different... Mozart with his katalog numbers..

>>92863393
>generational development
Sounds like a unique happening when you put it that way.
I remember a shit load of kids in my area wanted to be asian b-boys (high population) and silly break dancing was commmon when people were goofing around... that sounds like a lot of fun actually.
One of my goals has actually been appropriating IDM for people to *actually* be able to dance to lol...

>>92863402
Yeah I remember seeing both those names come up a lot on /mu/, but it still seemed pretty niche.

> always evolving and broad time periods
Yeah, that would make sense if you can stay focused in recognizable periods like that then.

>group projects by an opus number to keep projects of similar style, intent
If you're doing pieces with a lot of movements that sounds pretty useful.
My first long lasting system was grouped by genre folders and had a specific one for what I thought was representative of a personal evolving style while the rest were just practice/study etc (you know, lol).

What is the best way to learn trackers in 2023? What recourse should I be reading?

Is it better to just learn Renoise instead of trackers?
--- 92872443
>>92858166
literally you can help me, my 3rd question was about a legit cubase: "if i get legit cubase, can i use pirated sound content with it?"
i don't know yet how it works with cubase, but I assume if i buy a non-pro version, it will be missing some sound content exclusive to pro version
--- 92872509
>>92872443
i haven't used pirated content in more than a decade. cubase is nitpicky over what vsts it recognizes. when you point it to the folder, if it doesn't like the file, it won't show up in your instrument list. it's probably the most picky of any software i've used.
--- 92872647

(((steinberg)))
thanks for the reply. i'm using pirated Kontakt with pirated cinemastrings. maybe the apple way will save some huge headache (and money, if i can use pirated vsts in logic) in the long term
--- 92872685
>>92872647
just go pirate fl like everyone else does, you might be making things unnecessarily hard on your self
--- 92872816
>>92872685
i did use pirated FL for quite some time, the workflow was terrible for me after a while, even though I understand why people like it. switched to logic then and everything felt natural. the only problem I have with logic is the need for apple hardware and ecosystem. ergo my cubase questions

I hope ill figure out in the next 5 years, or so. Until then ill keep calling Renoise a tracker, because you cant use Renoise without the tracker.

Made some nice "ambient classical remix" but I'm unsure whether it's something I can ever release as it has ~1 minute of a piano recording sampled.
