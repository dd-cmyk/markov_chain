Kotominei is a Christian and doesn't want to associate with heretics like Illya unless he absolutely has to. Its why he kidnaps her in Fate but saves her in HF- to help birth AM in the former and to help AM and destroy Shirou in the latter scenario.

Originally there was plan to release FSN in way how Nasu is releasing Tsukihime remake now. With first part being named Fate/Stay Night and contain only Fate and UBW routes. And later would come second part named Fate/Other Night and contain Sakura Route and Illya Route.

Fate/side material
https://www.tmdict.com/en/#?nav=ja&amp;src=fate-side-material

>Rejected Routes

Exactly what it sounds like. Route ideas that didn’t make the cut.
In the beginning, the plan was for Fate/stay night to have four different routes, one for each heroine.
It would start off by letting the player arbitrarily choose between playing as either Shirou or Rin. Then around the middle of the story they would finally meet, and after that you would branch off into one of the four routes for the last half of the game. Yeah, I don’t really understand how it was going to work either.
Anyway, getting back to the rejected routes, it goes without saying that the Illya route tops the list.
Besides that, there was also the “Rider route where you fight against Rin and Saber,” and the “Caster route where Caster gets turned into a loli and becomes your partner.”
While all traces of the Caster route were completely erased, the development where you teamed up with Rider was actually folded into part of the final story.
If the Illya route had made it into the game, the diversion point probably would have been on the ninth day of the Sakura route. Instead of choosing between being a superhero and choosing Sakura, there would be a third choice where you could choose Illya.
But unfortunately, as it stands that choice doesn’t exist.

>UBW

The title of the Rin route. During the plotting stage, it was also the subtitle of Fate/stay night itself.
The name showed up in the “upcoming works” section of the pamphlets we distributed at the 2001 Winter Comiket, but I wonder how many people in Japan actually noticed it?
--- 251333320
>>251317713 (OP)
well, we can guess a bit from elements from HF that were incorporated from her canceled route, I think her rescue definitely was a thing from her route, as well as her sacrificing herself for Shirou (maybe we would have gotten a good ending where she lives). All in all it would have been much better than what we got
--- 251333365
>>251329171
Why was Shirou such a pedo in Hollow Ataraxia anyway? In Stay Night he always treats his relationship with Illya as purely platonic, but in HA he's perving on her all the time.
--- 251333386
>>251317713 (OP)
Shirou giving up his ideals for his cute sadistic loli imouto/nee-san, instead of doing that for a certain thot that likes to have sex with her brother
--- 251333423
>>251333365
Illya is 18, technically she is the pedo
--- 251333700
>>251317713 (OP)
We know that the existing HF route incorporated the Illya route, so basically decisions that give you Illya points throughout would functionally have served as the basis for the route. I’d suggest you can use that to visualise the general path. It would likely have had two ends, one where she lives (a bit like the Fate route end) and one where she has the Dress of Heaven and does what she does in HF.

Personally I’d have rather seen the “Illya route” than the HF route we got given how central she is to the history of the Fuyuki HGWs, but it’s a bit late for that.

Nasu mentioned in several interviews that he still has the drafts for Satsuki's route and Illya's route
--- 251334011

In fact, considering that Satsuki is finally getting her route, there may be hope for Illya.

Well, original plan way two-part release. With only first part being named Fate/Stay Night. This part was supposed to include only Saber and Rin route. And essentially being "Near side" of Fate story. Second part had be released later under title "Fate/Other Night" and was supposed to include Sakura's and Illya's routes. At first Nasu wanted to make two separate VNs since Saber + Illya + Sakura + Rin routes would be too huge

During production, however, writing of Sakura route lasted much longer than originally expected. And overall delay caused the production team to realize that 2-part release would be too expensive for them. So it was eventually decided that everything would be released in single game. Illya route was canceled and it's primal plot points were integrated into Sakura's route, which gave birth to HF route as we know it today. The Illya route plot points were integrated into HF, FHA and FZ. Nasu confirmed that Irisviel's/Illya's small bird familiars were from the draft of Illya's route 

>Q: For the battle scene between Rin and Ilya in the anime, did Ilya just get way stronger?! Was her strength based on 「Fate/Zero」? &lt;UMA>

>Nasu: If it's at the land that houses the Holy Grail, then Ilya is indeed that strong. And being able to make a familiar from her hair was in the original draft. The work this time around was especially hard, so I ended up using an "Iri's replacement" approach. By the way, the name of the technique is Elfen Lied [German for Elves' Song, 天使の詩 - Angel's Poem]. The bird's name is Storch Fieseler [German term for a type of plane]. The Ibis that shoots bullets is Zahre (tear), and she can also transform them into an Épée (a sword).

>Takeuchi: Woah, that's the first I heard of that.

>Nasu: Yea, and it all sounded rather neat when I submitted it. Director Miura can create good results as long as I force everything upon him. Kinoko, remember this.

The suggestion you would have to fight true Saber rather than Salter sounds pretty tough but anything with Rider is alright in my book (I assume this means Shiro summons her rather than Sakura?)

>The Stray Servant who was one of the original heroine candidates for the visual novel and would eventually be reworked into Mash was first briefly mooted as a route heroine during initial production (though quickly scrapped as there was no way there'd be time for her). Described as an "abandoned puppy-type heroine", she was going to be a Servant from the Fourth Holy Grail War who killed her Master and survived until the Fifth, like Gilgamesh. As a Shielder, she was also going to be Saber's rival. With the DEEN anime, Nasu has claimed there to be two planned concepts to bring her back into the story
>In 2005, during initial planning, he had planned for her to replace Assassin as the gatekeeper to Ryuudou Temple. In this scenario, Saber would've had to overcome the mental block of fighting someone she knew in her past life
>In 2006, it was subsequently reworked to have a girl named Tachie who died in the Fuyuki Fire at the end of the Fourth War, but was revived by a necromancer for the Fifth and used as a vessel for Galahad as the necromancer's Servant. She would have held a grudge against Shirou because she felt like he abandoned her while she was calling for help in the fire, but would have ended up coming to terms with her death and his survival, and died again saving Shirou.
>>251351450
You're in a series where there's like 30 saber/Rins running around and you're saying a second shielder is impossible?

Does sound pretty interesting desu. The whole death/resurrection shtick does sound like it was reworked into Bazett/Avenger's plotline in HA,

I think they confirmed it was actually Fate route Shirou that became Archer, but Illya route does make sense. He never found a way to save her (either she sacrificed herself like HF or her body broke down after the war like she told us would happen) so he became extra obsessed with saving everyone.

Whenever Nasu says something happens on the "Sacchin route timeline" or the "Illya route timeline", it's just shorthand for "some route that doesn't exist". He's used "Taiga route" a few times, too.
--- 251359877

It's worth noting that the reason the Caster and Rider routes were tossed around was because Sakura didn't exist as a character at that point. She was a pretty late addition to the cast.

Its kind of ridiculous that despite baiting hard in his vns, Nasu never explored a proper polygamous relationship between the protag and some of the heroines. I can see Saber/Rin/Shirou and Salter/Medusa/Sakura/Shirou from Fate and Shiki/Akiha/Maids in Tsukihime. I feel he can make a compelling story out of such an arrangement. ArcxcielxShiki doesn't count.

Reminder 
Q: In the Fifth Holy Grail War that Archer was retracing, were the inner dealings of the Matou clan or Sakura’s circumstances known? If he had known, how did Sakura look through Archer’s eyes in this particular Holy Grail War? &lt;Black Pawn>

Nasu: That Archer only has “memories of Saber” when it concerns the Holy Grail War. When he was summoned, seeing his summoned before him, he started to acknowledge things around Rin as “his own things.” The inner dealings of the Matou clan is something he didn’t know before turning into a Servant, and Sakura’s current circumstances were something he deduced after being summoned for the Holy Grail War. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that he would assist Sakura. Archer is Archer. It’s not the guy.

VN's weren't designed around polygamous relationships back when Nasu wrote them. By the time he was skilled enough as a writer he had stopped writing VNs. Also I feel like the Ciel good end fits the bill of polygamous relationship, even if its short.

There is quite a bit of strange dialogue like that in F/SN. Shirou's relationships with and throughts about women are an aspect of him that can be very weird at times. I'm not too sure how much is intentional Shirou being weird and how much is just Nasu being weird about women.

"He who tells the truth will be abhorred in a world of lies"
Srsly what do you want, a feminist harem protagonist in a hentai VN?

probably Nasu's weird sense of humor, I remember kokutou the most harmless guy in Nasuverse joked about assaulting Fujino when she stayed in his room because "he's a guy haha"

I don't really care, I just find it weird. Take
>For a girl, going outside at nine o'clock is like midnight. But she still said it's early... Is Tohsaka not self-conscious that she's a girl?
Is going outside at nine o'clock in the evening really that strange in Japan for a 17 year old? Japan's crime statistic is better than my own country and I don't think anyone would bat an eye at that. Likewise, the wording of "self-conscious that she's a girl?" is just plain weird.

Could be, but if it is, it's humour that's beyond me.

From what I gather it's just an amalgamation of the translation and intentional oddness that's meant to have been a result of being raised by Kiritsugu.

It's more of an asian thing.
It's not lady-like for a girl to go out at night.

We will get her route with AI 
>AI voice sampling that can read any line perfectly in Illya's voice
>AI story writing trained on all of Nasu's stories and sex scenes
>AI generated art that blows all of his past works out of the water
It is inevitable and it will be kino.

Kokutou strikes me as the kind of guy who's either extremely submissive or extremely dominant to the point of putting Shiki to shame.

If i remember correctly, shirou was originally supposed to be a female and all the servants male like a reverse harem but the editor forced a change and king arthur or saber became female
--- 251374643
>>251317713 (OP)
just sex
--- 251374761
>>251362195
Illya could just beat the shit out of all of them besides Saber for judging him.
--- 251374855
>>251317713 (OP)
Sex, copulation, mana transfer and more sex.

But...It's completely with Shirou's consent, right?

Why does Muramasa not have a VN despite being the peak of visual novels?

Muramasa is too good to adapt

It would make an excellent shitposting trainwreck of an anime that would destroy the board. Think something like Franxxx or Code Geass.

Could be worse, ill take anything at this point.

How come OG Illya x Shirou doujins are so rare?
--- 251382196
>>251380492
They're rare not because they don't exist but because scans were far more uncommon in the early 2000s
--- 251382885
>>251379251
Didn't she live with Shirou until she died?
--- 251384731
>>251382885
How long did Illya live though? You would think Shirou or the other girls would try to find a way to increase her lifespan
--- 251386372
>>251317713 (OP)
Abandoned and disgusting.
--- 251386435
>>251384731
Illya went into the grail war thinking she'd die becoming the Holy Grail, I think she was content with the time she had left at that point.
--- 251387514
>>251377881
It says a lot about Illya's character development that she didn't immediately kill him when he did that.
--- 251389788
>>251317713 (OP)
Cute and funny
--- 251391811
In my mind, an OG Illya sex scene would start out with her acting all yandere and trying to dominate Shirou, but afterwards she would just cuddle him a lot.
--- 251394664
>>251326695
that sounds really cool
