What are /g/'s thoughts on Ares OS?
It is sort of like an onion os, made from many layers:
- Helios: A microkernel at the heart of Ares
- Mercury: A driver framework for Ares
- Venus: A collection of drivers
- Gaia: an userspace programming environment
+ Luna: POSIX compatibility layer (optional)

These all together form the Ares OS, which will be a high level OS with a package manager, wayland support and more!

One of the more interesting features of Ares OS, is that it doesn't have a monolithic kernel.
Instead, drivers are running in userspace with the help of the capability system. A neat thing is also that all processes will inherit drivers from their parents, which means that a parent can re-implement a driver capability for it's child processes, allowing for advanced sand boxing and also running multiple Ares operating systems in one, without using virtualization! Neat, huh?

See https://ares-os.org/
Currently, helios is apparently almost done, and mercury is being worked on. Work just started on Gaia.
Also see video related, it is a shell on the mercury layer. Pretty cool, huh?

Unironically the most promising project of the last couple off years. 
The ideas are all on spot (on paper), and the development proceed constantly 
Drew de Vault seems to be the kind of guy who does what he promises. 

For now it's too early to make any educated guess, but if devs don't fuck it up and skilled people join the project there is the potential to replicate the Unix/C phenomenon with Ares/hare

The port has some hacks by his own admission but still is kinda of an achievement.

> Hare is really a god language
It's good, not by an academic fashion but by being a small, simple language with few frills that get the job done. It's basically a modern C (really, not like zig) 
It's the only language I would be really happy to take over c

>So for once instead of cloning unix he's cloning Windows 
Where the fuck did you get that from?
Helios is a clone of seL4 and also unlike windows is a full ukernel

The userspace is Unix/Plan 9 inspired in the sense there one uniform resource abstraction and the whole os aims to be a fully network transparent distributed (still Plan 9 inspired but not with the thin client- fileserver paradigm)

Are you actually clinically retarded?
--- 92807271
>>92807247
>fully network transparent distributed (still Plan 9 inspired but not with the thin client- fileserver paradigm)
I heard that. But how does that work? You have a private key somewhere and every device with the same private key will be auto mounted somewhere and you will be able to run processes and control the filesystem on it?

It's a great idea and I'm happy to see something promising to compete with Fuchsia in the pipeline. I think forcing every driver to re-implement in a new programming language is a poor choice however; if the project can figure out how to play nice with (userspace) drivers written in C, it has a chance to copy the NetBSD rump drivers in to get a bunch of devices besides just virtio or whatever the community can maintain in Hare.

Also DDV is kind of a blowhard for banning all blockchain projects from sourcehut, I can never trust him not to be a moralizing leftist tool after that. Hopefully that attitude stays out of the Ares project.

Like all worthless toy operating systems, the memory management system is underdeveloped and there has clearly been no significant thought put into it. This is an especially great sin for a microkernel system where the situation is quite a bit more complex, and a non-robust plan for these things puts you in the coffin immediately. I don't need to check anything else, that alone re-confirms to me what I already thought, which is that devault is a blowhard cult leader who either likes the attention or just thinks he's way smarter than he is.

UNIX haters were, are and always will be retarded. Every large operating system becomes a mess, and the UNIX mess is the least bad of all of them and makes it the easiest to write portable code. The last time I had to debug something on NT it made me pull my hair out and drink. 

I hate non-UNIX systems so much it's unreal.

--- 92823580
>>92823385
I don't think either of these set it apart here. It's not as if Plan 9 has legacy concerns, and the kernel makes little difference when everything is done via ipc/rpc anyway. Combined with the fact you can swap the kernels out with the same userland on top as a result of that.
I'd have to hear why the difference in kernel architecture matters in this case.
--- 92823639
>>92823436
for one you don't need to know c++ or rust to hack on it
redox and managarm also seem less ambitious about building a new kind of userland
--- 92824169
>>92823580
i admit i'm not that well versed in Plan 9 or osdev but to me structuring the entire system from drivers to applications around a single "everything is a capability/kernel object" paradigm sounds like it would have advantages in isolation, flexibility and overall system clarity/simplicity

As you can see they are massively different, you basically have to rewrite Plan 9 (in another language) from scratch

Other Plan 9 ideas that could make it into Ares are private namespaces and lack of global filesystem, and probably the Plan 9 userspace
--- 92827440
>>92827411
Plan 9 userspace is almost certain at this point. Drew said, that the userspace will likely be heavily inspired by plan 9
--- 92828635
>>92827411
Very cool. Thanks for the breakdown. I'm actually interested in this.
Plan 9 is great in a lot of ways, especially compared to Unix. But the prospect of using something like it except with more modern lessons learned and practices is appealing. Especially if it's intended for actual use rather than purely research.
Not to say that Plan 9's C dialect or libraries are bad but I'd take almost anything over C these days.
I'm going to read more into this later.
--- 92830444
>>92827411
>It aims to be more practical
What does this mean? They're all planned to have full POSIX interoperability eventually so I can't see how one would be more practical than another for a user. Is it more practical for the devs, then? In what way? Is it just because of the simpler programming language or is there something specific about the architecture that makes it more practical than other microkernels?
