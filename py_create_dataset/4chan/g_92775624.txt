How do I avoid seething in anger to read someone complain that the flashdrive is too slow and doesn't have the advertised space when it's over the product section that it's 2.0 and there's a listing of the true storage that is going to be available? How do I cope with this? Thanks.

I bought 4 of these ESP32 boards, much better than the previous one i bought from another seller with better soldering and the PCB printing is easier to read when i cant remember which pin is what.
Unfortunately 1 was still partially DOA, doesn't draw power from the USB port but can from an external source. 
They came individually packaged in anti-static bags.
Being "dropship" who knows if it will be the same stock next time i order.
https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005178777574.html

in suppose you can leave all the unused SD cards in a sleep state or just limit the simultaneous reads, or maybe a liquid cooling pipe which runs along the device
someone out there will figure it out eventually
--- 92783850
>>92783761
Hardest part is figuring out what is fucked.
You need some basic multimeter and some patience.
If my GPU didn't have fuses it would be much harder to identify the issue.
It will be very hard to unsolder certain parts with just soldering iron. 
I have some cheap old sub 20€ piece of shit and it lacks power.
I suggest buying one where heating element is integrated with tip.
There are plenty of T12 soldering station knockoff on ali.

You can program it though serial right? You might just need a serial to usb adapter to program through the expansion board, but I don't see why you can't just connect a usb cable straight to the esp32 board while it's attached.

Stopping to think, i just dont know if there is something to prevent the hearing to become even worse.
--- 92789520
>>92789363
if it is too loud the person using it would lose more hearing. 
The problem comes that you don't lose hearing equally, you lose in a different way to different sounds pitch. Usually those chink shit cannot be equalized, and that it is their problem
If someone wants to hear the high pitch sounds they'll overload with the bass and mediums, when they should have one that just makes those frequencies louder. That can make them lose even more hearing.

I'm the guy who shilled the chink hearing aid. I used it for a month and a half for work. Didn't lose any more hearing (only one ear is hard of hearing) as far as I can tell. Loud noises, very high pitched sounds will probably make you lose hearing, but I have had hearing aids before and it is the same shit unless you are paying a lot for one.
--- 92789719
>>92789627
good for you man, i guess.
I only hope there is some chink one that can be equalized.

pic rel. Mobo is kinda miss advertized. The NICs are limited to 1gbs, m.2 are 3.0 1x, only one sata port is a full bandwidth port (the other 5 are multiplexed). PSU is probably chink cancer. Fine for home use by someone just starting out on /hsg/, but I'm looking for something I can put a 10gbs NIC into.

I wand the case though. I haven't seen just this case or something like it for sale. Do you think CWWK would bite if I sent them a message trying to buy just the case?

>1tb thumb drives late one night, and I dunno if I trust them. Because they are from china.
let me guess, you also got them super cheap?
did no alarm bells ring?
your 1tb usb drives are fake. run h2testw on them to get their actual capacity. They'll corrupt your data if you keep storing on there.

No like this:
I should be clear I meant from like reputable large brands not random shit you can get off ali that still uses USB 2.0.

>Where's the anon that said that Ali wasn't hiding seller info for him? Here's an example. Dogshit practice. And there's more...
That was me. Strange, never seen them do that before although I basically never click on front page ads so I guess that makes sense.
>>92798224
Like I said I know you can get them but at that price I also know there's no fucking way it's going to compete with the more modern Kingston card reader I use for my modern SD cards so I'm stuck keeping 2 readers around.
I checked the reviews for the most ordered one but I couldn't find any showing the read/write speeds.

If you were to wire the reader chips to a hub chip like the other anons suggested it would work fine in theory, you'll be limited by the bandwidth of the hub however.
Still 27 cards probably means you'll have to layer a few hub chips which could cause problems. 27 cards means 14 dual LUN controllers which would require 5 hubs.
--- 92802240
>>92802059
>Still 27 cards probably means you'll have to layer a few hub chips which could cause problems. 27 cards means 14 dual LUN controllers which would require 5 hubs.
NTA but how much power would that even draw? At some point you wouldn't even be able to use it on the majority of USB ports right?
--- 92802328
>>92802240
idk, since you can't use all cards at their max bandwidth it probably won't eat too much power. Though it might still go over 5W anyway.
--- 92802381
>>92782752
If i recall the issue is bandwidth on the reader. One reader has severe problems allocating read/write time between multiple cards over the same bus.
Not a 100% on this but I recall finding out something like this while trying to find a multi-card mpunting reader.
You could just make a bunch of very small readers but that would probably still need multiple usb-connectors or something.

Ah yes, the portable liquid cooled 27TB storage brick
--- 92802425

How do I even use AliExpress at this point? Their algorithm became so unbearable it actually makes it impossible to use their website. I wanted to browse and get a case for my phone. Started off with looking up "case for samsung galaxy s21". Sorted it by "Orders" and "4 stars+". Mainly got pretty mediocre results. Got past 3 pages and suddenly all the item squares were missing their pictures. Tried reloading, nothing helped. Tried going back and forth between pages, nothing happened. Waiting and repeating these steps didn't help either. Re-searching the same phrase didn't do anything. I had to change the phrase and formulate it differently in order for it it to work, to go back to normal browsing. I often, accidentally opened auctions with a nice looking phone case, only to realize they're only made for iPhones. Sometimes some auctions have an image of a different phone as a showcase, despite the fact it's available on a wide range of different models. That being said, because I repeatedly opened auctions for iPhones again and again, it has come to a point where I still look up cases for my samsung but 80% of the results are now just purely iPhone cases. What in the fuck is that? It's like transverse a maze with all kinds of bullshit traps and gimmicks, I don't get it. I used this website couple of times throughout the years but I've never seen such bullshit before...
--- 92809332
>>92809282
I also kept seeing some weird ass ads in a form of suggested auctions for those magical products that make your skin beautiful or for your bald head to suddenly start growing hair again and stuff like that, so I unmuted my microphone that I have plugged into my PC and I've asked them to stop showing me these ads because I am not insecure about myself and I don't need any of those things and to please stop bothering me and all those ads disappeared and they're gone now????

disrupt the market and start dropshipping them on Amazon. Buy bulk (you'll probably get discounted to $10/unit), store them at an Amazon fulfillment center, and sell for $15-$20. You'll be doing people in the US a favor, and making a little money on the side.

>the speed is absolute garbage
5400RPM laptop HDDs of that era get around 70MB/s sequential R/W with &lt;1MB/s random R/W and &lt;100 random IOPS.
The only limiting factor of those things is USB 2.0 so ~30something MB/s sequential but modern microSD cards get at least 5MB/s random R/W and random IOPS in the 800s, still an upgrade over the factory drive.
Needless to say, both of these are perfectly fine for running Linux.

The BR-IRS is not going to find people to increase efficiency out of nowhere, so they will probably keep doing sampling for a while.

No, I'm telling you that a modern microSD card would be perfectly fine and even an upgrade in random operations over the factory 5400 RPM drive for a laptop of the pre-mSATA era.
Also if he bought that thing to use the USB signal from mini PCIe as main storage it's pretty safe to assume that his SATA port is either broken or will be used for something else.

On aliexpress I buy shit that I can usually only get from supplier websites, places like mouser or digikey, but they'll charge me $20 for shipping even though I'm only buying 1 8 pin CPU header and an audio jack which in total weigh like 5g and occupy a 3x5x5cm space.
Aliexpress is also the only good place for me to find more niche but expensive stuff like specific laptop display panels
Amazon is genuinely getting worse as time goes on, their search has gotten nearly as bad as ali and the products are getting.

Currently only imports over $50 are taxed by 60% (plus +18% on some states) but Dear Chang marks all prices down and mislabels everything so almost nothing is taxed. Unless you have bad luck and a customs wagie just so happens to take an interest in your package.
There are talks to apply the tax to absolutely all imports instead of the current non-functioning system.
Nothing has been done yet, no laws passed. A provisional measure may pass in the coming weeks/months.
There has not been a new wave of customs officers.
But the customs wagies have received a wakeup call and a greater number of packages than normal have either been taxed or returned.
Basically, a nothingburger (for the moment).
--- 92822222
>>92819574
The government is enacting a new fiscal policy which include cuts and taxation in order to fund spending (basic services like healthcare, education and public safety) and later reduce inflation by decreasing the interest rate, so it needs a buttload of money. The problem is that one of these targets for taxation is to actually increase the efficiency of import customs. Currently, we get a gargantuan amount of stuff from China and customs does part of the checking by sampling: it gets an item from a container and applies a filter for scrutiny depending on the item. They also scan stuff and do selective targeting by aiming at "big packages", but still a lot of stuff still gets through tax free, which currently can be 60% of the product price (import tax) + 16-20% (state tax). 

The narrative being pushed is that the government is doing a crackdown on certain stores (Aliexpress, Shein, Shopee) that use (actually the sellers in there) a legal loophole so the customer don't pay anything, essentially they pretend to be a natural person, they lie about how much the product costs and they fraction (break apart) the purchase, if possible, in many different boxes so they get smaller packaging. That's acceptable since they are committing fraud and all, but the real game being played is actually to increase the amount of scrutiny so more stuff gets taxed, 60% and all that, abandoning sampling or forcing the stores to calculate on their side, leaving Brazilians which not much choice except pay the tax if they want the product.

Brazil is a poor country and a lot of people buy these products from Aliexpress etc because either is expensive to buy inside the country or because there's no alternative here. Also sometimes when it comes to clothing for example, the product is simply better than the shit they sell it here. The situation is dire to the point of people actually surviving on importation by reselling this stuff here.
--- 92822317
>>92822222
I want to explain more, but I'm sleepy as hell. So maybe later if you have any questions or whatever. Or any huebro wants to append anything to it.

But just to add a bit: it's a change that affect a lot of people and the government basically opened a can of worms with the way they approached it. There's also some stuff regarding this lobbying which was done by big retail stores in the name of protecting "the industry". It's something that has been pushed for some time, including in the previous government under Bolsonaro.
--- 92822838
>>92813156
Don't worry, brazilian reviews will disappear soon, but we buy stuff because the alternative is buying from local dealers and paying 3x-10x the price due to retarded tax policies + scalping. As for russians, well it's cheap and shipping must be pretty fast since they are close to China.

Wouldn't be so sure since there's no mention of random speeds but yeah I'm posting this from a Win10 LTSC install running off an mSATA SSD inside an USB 3.0 enclosure.
I just prefer enclosures + my own drive than "a built one" for these things, especially when you install a drive with DRAM cache inside.

I have given up on getting the Lego Porsche technic from the seller I paid who is refusing to send it out. He's telling me he lost money on the product during the promotion period but sounds like bullshit given he left the listing up during the whole damn sales period.

When's the next sale? Also do you think all the sellers just use the same shit when it comes to counterfeit lego sets or will some be better than others? Don't know if going for a newer seller who's cheaper than others is worth it

>inb4 just buy it already you retarded cheapskate
No thanks. I'm a cheapskate chinkshitter for a reason.

Any of you tried this?
I need a gamepad to play PS/PS2 games that just works and has decent buttons and d-pad and I don't want to pay for a greasy as fuck used DS2.

I haven't but if it's an official 8bitdo then I've heard good things. You can find them on Amazon too where there'll likely be a shit ton of reviews so you know what they're like rather than Ali's 5 star "received it haven't used yet" reviews

No, but in case you are not aware, Gulikit and 8BitDo are supposedly god-tier/top-tier chink gamepad makers. They are probably the best Aliexpress has to offer when it comes to third-party controllers. Gamesir (also a famous brand over there) recently launched a new gamepad with Hall Effect (reduces or eliminates stick drift).

I’m in the Philippines right now. What should I buy from Ali? I can get my items very fast and cheap. I want a Nintendo switch, are those legit on Ali?

I have a sn30pro+, bought one when the pandemic started to play vidya because what else are you gonna do? battery pack died within one year replaced it with a rechargeable off the shelf AA, the sticks are wearing out. Heard you can replace it with from the manufacturer directly. Dpad is losing input feel. Still plays decently after all these years. overall good for like ~$30

I know this was caused by a pajeet, women, or other diversity hire somewhere down the line. The chang fears the incompetent westerner.

No problem, be sure to update how it is if you get it. I'm interested in getting one myself


>>92829600
Sounds like shit's falling apart lel
--- 92830205
Speaking of 8bitdo, they make an adapter for the Switch that you can use to get other controllers like PS controllers to connect and play with
Are there cheaper chinkshit alternatives?
Because the 8bitdo needs 1 usb per controller

>>92830205
I bought this one: https://aliexpress.com/item/1005004267992231.html (R100)
But it's getting dust, haven't tested so far. And there is also this other one: https://aliexpress.com/item/1005003500753817.html (DS50)
The most famous one is the Wingman Converter. Pic related. The problem is that iirc he only comes in versions PS > Xbox and vice-versa. These alternates are sluts that will go with everything.

Now that I checked the 8BitDo is just a bit more expensive than these ones I posted, the only real difference is that the 8BitDo doesn't work with modern consoles like PS3/4/5. Ignore it.
