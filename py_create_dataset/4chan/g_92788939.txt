>>92788939 (OP)
The Lamy Safari is widely regarded as one of the best pens ever made, and for good reason. With its ergonomic design, durable construction, and smooth writing experience, it has become a favorite among writers, artists, and students alike. 

First and foremost, the Lamy Safari is incredibly comfortable to use. The pen's design is based on the principles of ergonomics, which means that it is shaped to fit comfortably in the hand, reducing fatigue and strain during long writing sessions. The pen's grip is designed to be both soft and sturdy, allowing for a comfortable grip that doesn't slip. This is especially important for students and professionals who spend hours writing every day, as it reduces the risk of hand cramps and other repetitive stress injuries.
--- 92788978
>>92788955
In addition to its ergonomic design, the Lamy Safari is also extremely durable. The pen's body is made of high-quality materials such as ABS plastic, which is both lightweight and strong. This means that the pen can withstand the wear and tear of daily use without cracking or breaking, ensuring that it will last for years to come. The pen's nib is made of stainless steel, which is resistant to corrosion and can withstand the pressure of heavy use without bending or breaking.

One of the most important factors in any pen is its writing performance, and the Lamy Safari does not disappoint. The pen's nib is designed to provide a smooth and consistent flow of ink, making writing effortless and enjoyable. The pen is also refillable, which means that users can easily replace the ink when it runs out, rather than having to buy a new pen every time.
--- 92789006
>>92788978
Another advantage of the Lamy Safari is its versatility. The pen is available in a range of colors, allowing users to choose the one that best suits their style and personality. It is also available in a variety of nib sizes, from extra fine to broad, making it suitable for a wide range of writing styles and applications.

Finally, the Lamy Safari is affordable, making it accessible to anyone who wants a high-quality pen without breaking the bank. While there are certainly more expensive pens on the market, few can match the Lamy Safari in terms of quality, durability, and performance.

In conclusion, the Lamy Safari is the best pen ever made because of its ergonomic design, durability, smooth writing experience, versatility, and affordability. Whether you are a student, a professional, or an artist, the Lamy Safari is a pen that is sure to meet your needs and exceed your expectations.

I have great memories with the G-2. I even started looking for them in my market a year ago. When I couldn't find them I bought the closest thing, a Uni 207.
Since then I've moved onto it, pic related, and even daily carry them for 3 pens now, which is unheard of for me. They are phenomenal, and have incredible ink. Unlike the G-2, they haven't skipped on me ever.

At one point it was a practical choice that the mainstream looked at as 'uncool' or 'nerdy' because it was ugly even though it was the superior product of it's category at a time. Places like reddit and /g/ turned it into a pop culture icon as a way to flex on "normies" who "just don't know" and at this point it's the incel version of middle schoolers wearing Supreme. I do have a Safari and it is great but it's like, I'm not jacking off about my toyota corolla every day....

Are parker ink cartridges actually proprietary or can I use them in other brand pens?
--- 92793625
I can't always stand around and unpost my pen in the middle of walk. That's why I use Capless Decimo (Capless is too fat, and I have huge hands), but always keep around a Jotter loaded with Schmidt P900 and a Zebra Blen to lend to people.
The fact Japan is much closer to me that Europe also leans me more towards Japanese stuff, as I had my nib serviced for about 7 dollars at Pilot, they can do a nib replacement for about 40.

What? Why the bias against Parker? I don't have their cartridges but I sometimes use their Quink ink bottles; they're nothing special but they are cheap so what's to complain about here?

This is another reason I'm interested in knowing if they're compatible with non-parker pens, they're probably the cheapest most available ink in my area.
--- 92794107
>>92794004
I've used my Parker inks with some non-Parker pens, didn't notice any issues. I mean, look, reputable fountain pen inks can be used in almost any other brands' fountain pens. You take any ink and put it in any pen, 90% of the time there'll be very little issue.

In my experience, the only time I've noticed 'incompatibility' is when I used my Pelikan Edelstein (which is a slightly more viscous ink) in my Sailor pen with a MF nib. The viscosity causes the ink flow to not be as buttery smooth in a Japanese fine nib, but even then it still can write.
--- 92794193
>>92793715
There's never a time I would pick Quink over something else. And this is coming from someone who used Quink during my school years (2000s) because that's all there was access to.
If anything, it's is easily available.
Feathers on office paper (although I'm aware most people seem to say it doesn't) and there's nothing special about it, the black is underwhelming also. No waterproofness or archival qualities, so I can't use it for anything I want permanence for.
Don't see how saving a few dollars every 6 months to a year is worth it for me.

>>92793801
Any specific one? I use the Jetstream multipen.
--- 92794216
>>92794107
What I'm asking is if the refill cartridges will fit in other non-parker cartridge pens specifically.

Tho I suppose taking the ink out of them with a needle is always an option.
--- 92794717
You guys never seem to post or consider vintage pens much. A lot of the people here are focused on cheap pens which usually work well enough and are easy to replace, but some talk about more expensive pens like from Opus 88. That's solid vintage price range for very nice and reliable pens. Probably not NOS but great condition workhorses like the Parker 51. Sheaffer Snorkel too maybe, but I don't have experience with them. For the most part I would just stick with the Safari or Metro/Kakuno if I didn't want to jump in price to the well reliable vintage models.
--- 92795152
>>92794717
>You guys never seem to post or consider vintage pens much
There's very little interest whenever i post my vintages. 
>That's solid vintage price range for very nice and reliable pens.
Most people wouldn't be willing to spend $50~100 here which is the solid price range for a pen from a first tier vintage maker restored. when you start going under that price you're typically looking at 2nd or 3rd teir makers like wearever.
tbqh the lower priced beginner vintages pens have risen in value to a point i wouldn't buy.
>Sheaffer Snorkel 
i'd consider this a slightly risky purchase if you plan on buying from ebay since people have a hard time restoring them correctly so even when they say they've restored it some chances are it won't be right.
--- 92795510
>>92795152
Yeah that may have been bad to include I just always though it looked like a super usable pen if in good shape. I'm pretty much done looking at pens now and want to shit out my grievances before I just use a 51 if not a gel pen for the rest of time. HERE GOES
--- 92795575
Fountain pens: Modern US pens are fucking trash. Most modern pens are overpriced at best. The best ones are all pretty much entry level japanese. Anything other then cartridge-converter is even more obscenely overpriced. Get a Lamy Safari or Pilot Metro/Kakuno for the cheapest best pens. If you learn a little about vintage pens you can find good value with filling mechanisns that arent cartridge-converter. 

Nibs: Any nib can be any type of nib that isn't a larger one. Most are all shit from the manufacturer, from 20-500 dollars. Pay a nibsmith like 20 or 30 bucks to grind it to a width you want, smooth and get it running consistent. Gold isn't much of a factor and mostly a superficial luxury. Modern SS nibs don't seem to have rust issues, and gold's "softness" is probably completely unnoticed 
by the majority or people using it, if it isn't a hard nib regardless. Flex is an entirely different type of nib that the majority of people don't need or use and make finding a pen impossibly more difficult.

All of this is irrelevant if you want a specific pen. It will cost a ton more though for no reason unless you're buying it for a very specific type of use.

Get a Safari or a Metro/Kakuno, and still expect to send it to a nibsmith to get it running well and consistent. Get a fine (Japanese not Euro) nib if you want it to be useful on most paper and not a thick bleeding mess. If you want to splurge get a Lamy 2k or a Parker 51 in good condition for a better ink capacity. A JoWo or Bock nib unit is nice if you like throwing it in
different pen bodies or spending lots of money trying new ones.

I own three old Sheaffers and a Parker from my Dad. He gave it to me when he retired. Not exactly "vintage" in the sense of it being from the 70s or earlier, but they are older pens, still. One of them has a slightly loose cap though, which I'm not sure how to fix. It's a pop cap, not the screw type, but that pen tends to dry after even a day of not using it due to the seal not being air tight.

Just stick to rollerballs if you like them so much.
Since it's a ball, I think it's physically, inherently smoother.
The point of fountain pens is the writing angle and smoothness. Rollerballs have the smoothness of fountain pen ink and the slippery-ness of a ball. But the ball dictates you have to write at a higher angle.

Fountain pens aren't about glass-like smoothness.

I can see why eye-droppers aren't more common.
It doesn't spurt on me, but it leaks ink all the time. By leak, I mean it sort of just lets too much ink onto the nib and said ink blobs onto the paper.

Now, I know that to prevent this, it is ideal to fill it up once it drops to around 3/4 empty. But, at that point, one would be re-filling it at the same rate as a converter.

Rollerballs are nice but fp's have a lot of advantages to them. The preppy is smooth as fuck and most certainly matches and probably is smoother, but you may have gotten a bad nib or haven't found the sweet spot. The sweet spot is the correct angle. Of course rollerballs have the sweet spot almost everywhere.
There are other advantages like backwriting with finer lines and line variation, which you can get very little with the Preppy, but it's still there.
Nothing wrong with Pilot Rollerballs (except the non permanent ink), I use the V5 sometimes but the Preppy more often.

It's only sold in mainland china so a lot of people think it's a ripoff, but it's legitimate. Not many people go for it because it has to be imported and Pilot/Platinum have similar pens that don't have to deal with that, but it's the only EF nib that's not "cut off" like that of Plumix, at that price of course.

Metal corrodes. What you really want is an ebonite feed.

You haven't stated that you want them in restored condition but I'm going to assume you want them restored.
>Where would one even buy vintage pens?
Quite a few places. Ebay, retailers and quite a few personal sites out (Professional restorers etc.) all offering quite good pens.
If you already have a pen/brand in mind then there are specialty sellers.
Ebay is "generally" the cheapest place to buy as retailers and professionals charge a mark-up (about 15~20% but can go as high as 50%)
>Is ebay alright?
It should be fine for cheaper sac based pens, just know what you're getting into and make sure that they are in fact restored. Quite a few reputable sellers there (and sellers that people think are reputable but not).
>>92816664
There are other legitimate places where you'd want a watch like if you were working in an intrinsically safe environment.

>>92816360

>>92814484

I think both consumer and manufacturers are to blame. Back in the 1920"s people would be willing to spend up to $7 for a good quality pen (just under half a weeks wages). these days you have people haggling for under $7 (like 10 mins worth of wages)

Oh yeah it probably won't, we probably have another 100 or 200 years still, but I enjoy thinking about how these relatively old technologies we keep around might look like when my grandchildren or great grandchildren are around. 

>don't we already have plastics that arn't oil based or do those still suck?

AFAIK (And I'm no expert) there's some pretty promising plastic alternatives, but plastic is very varied in properties so I'm not entirely sure if those alternatives (assuming they're ever implemented on mass) would be able to supplant with very specific properties that I assume is requires for the feed.

Opinion discarded.
Vintage pens are usually built more solidly, with better resin, and when they have better nibs they destroy modern pens.
Have you ever used an old flex nib?
--- 92827476
>>92820275
Based.
Yes, that's actually what I'm using right now. Before that I was using the 207 and most recently the 207 Micro. But they're all great. 307 feels like nicer smoother ink, greasier, more pigmented, and apparently it was designed to write on all surfaces.
I may go back to 207 Micro for daily carry, but that's only because I write small in my small daily notebook.

these have always intimidated me, I tried ink with a brush on rice paper like trad Chinese style and the ink spread so quickly you had to be very deliberate and precise and it seemed like a skill that would take years to refine just to get something remotely presentable.

No, it's not so complicated to use.
You can see in my photograph that I used Pelikan 4001, which is for fountain pens. Dip pen ink might work better but fountain pen ink works quite fine. Just wipe the nib on the bottle once or twice to remove excessive ink.

have you tried calling them cucks for following a international legal status? did it work? maybe call for a boycott of the evil lamy company. they probably have nazi roots given that htey are from germany so you can use that

You didn't quite get it. There's nothing wrong with owning 4 pencils, and nothing wrong with a nice carrying case.

They could have got a 600 since it's carried in a case, but they don't even carry that case.

I imagine that consooming lets them get a feeling that maybe someday they'll do something important with them. It is frankly very hard to justify fancy pens if your calligraphy is shit, you suck at drawing, and don't need to handwrite anything on your everyday life.

It's so hard to start writing in paper. I'm so used to vomiting my toughs into a word document knowing I can erase and improve it slowly afterwards, but I can't bring myself to press the pen down into the paper until I know that what I wanna say will work 100% and it just doesn't seem to happen ever.

Bought my dad a Jinhao 35 as his first fountain pen, I was worried when I saw the review of his falling apart. But the only issue is how slick the grip section is, the Fine nib writes extremely fucking well and he's actually been trying to draw landscapes with it.

I use a Lamy Safari and I'm planning to get the 20 dollar Heart of Darkness ink for the free pen, and the 'Turquoise of the Mesas' blue for the shading effect. I think it'd be fun to draw with. Besides that. Lamy Safaris are fun. I like the idea of a durable looking pen to be carry around with my sketchbook. 
One thing I'd like is to possibly engineer a traveling inkwell that is NOT fucking 35 or 70 dollars. They're both friction fit, so having to pay 70 dollars for some cheap injection molding, silicone and 50 cents worth of glass is fucking gay. I'm planning on buying my own bottles off of amazon and drilling holes into the caps to design my own traveling inkwell in the caps.

Apparently they changed up the barrel and changed the ink formula. My favorite pen channel dude says it's a bit more water, fraud and fade resistant.
I'd use it instead of the 207 just for those features (besides the barrel, which looks ugly). In fact, I would just get the refill and pop it in the faux carbon 307 body, which is my favorite "batman" body.

I only have noodlers black, and it's a really nice black. Only problem is that it really doesn't respond well to kneaded erasers no matter how long you wait, so I would still use fineliners and india ink for anything you're going to spend a decent amount of time penciling first, saving the fountain pen more as a sketching tool

It really is. In fact, one of the deepest, most matte, flattest blacks I've ever seen.
I just hate that it smudges (when touching, erasing or mixing mediums) on anything other than the finest platinum, 0.2.
