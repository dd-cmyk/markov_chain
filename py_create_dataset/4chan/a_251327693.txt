Rushed and most of characters will die in 5 chapters or so. Then Gojo will return, save the day and both Itadori and Megumi will die at the very end. 

My guess is that Itadori dies by Gojo's hand and Megumi by Angel's.

Dunno about the details. But I'm guessing its gonna be something like everyone takes on Kenny and Sukuna at once. Gojo stalemating Sukuna while the rest try to gangbang Kenny.
Gojo dies to Sukuna, but wears him out/damages him/hinders him/whatever leaving him vulnerable to Megumi. Megumi starts fucking with Sukuna, and blah blah blah lots of deaths blah blah blah, we eventually end up with a 2.0 of the end of the Cursed Womb arc: Megumi sacrfices himself to save Yuji/everyone. "Have a long life, Itadori."

There's no way Gojo is getting unsealed next chapter. This chapter was Gege setting up false hope. Thematically, the series has always been about how fucked up it is for one person to carry the responsibilities of the entire jujutsu world on his shoulders and it would be a humongous cop-out for the series to end with Gojo once again cleaning up everyone else's mess.

Megumi will wrest back control from Sukuna at a crucial moment and kill himself in front of Yuuji, mirroring Yuuji's death in the Cursed Womb arc.

We're going to find out that Kenjaku was on Yuuji's side all along, just like a real mother. He scraps his plans because Yuuji's ability to overcome adversity is more entertaining than finding out what happens when you turn Japan into a giant human dango.

Only if they have BMT, like Choso. Considering what Eso and Kechizu had, they might just have had a variety of blood themed powers.

>>251336924
what if he ate all of them, sorta like Sukuna and his fingers?
--- 251337722
>>251337196
Why would that matter? They're not one being split into 8. They're eight separate beings. Its still just a potential of six different CTs from the fetuses. We don't even know if any of them HAD CTs. So either Yuji gets one of their CTs becoming their vessel and the others get converted into CE boosts, or he gets potentially six different CTs I guess?

Plus, if Yuji ate them(which I don't buy to begin with. Even the Nips are split on that), I don't get why he would get anything to begin with. The fetuses have been dead since the Death Paintings arc. They've been rotting away and decomposing for months. They should have no CE to absorb. And I could maybe understand some hidden "eat a dead nigga, get their power" mechanic, if the body was fresh. But months dead? Nah.
Either people are misunderstanding that moment, OR this is purely some gross "eat this fetuses, so they live on in you" symbolic measure because Choso and Yuji are mindfucked now.

The fanbook actually answers this question.
>Q: What happens if Itadori, who is resistant to curses, eats a Death Painting Womb?
>A: Either the Death Painting Womb will become something like Sukuna’s current state, or the Death Painting Womb itself will disappear and become cursed energy within Itadori. If Itadori ingests it after he is already a host for Sukuna, the Death Painting Womb will just be obliterated by Sukuna.
Since Yuuji didn't get Sukuna's cursed technique (although that's still up in the air!), he probably wouldn't get anything from the Death Paintings. Then again, it doesn't entirely make sense that Choso was able to channel Eso and Kechizu's powers against Kenjaku, so maybe there's some black magic brotherfuckery going on.
>>251337722
I agree that it's more likely to be figurative, but I'm curious about your take on this part of their exchange.
>Y: 'Thank you.'
>C: 'It's fine.'
>Y: 'No... I mean, about the brothers.'
What is Yuuji thanking Choso for 'about the brothers'? If he's just offering his sympathies or apologizing, I don't think he would say 'arigatou.' Unless there's some context I'm missing because IWNBJ.

>>251338017
>Then again, it doesn't entirely make sense that Choso was able to channel Eso and Kechizu's powers against Kenjaku, so maybe there's some black magic brotherfuckery going on.
He didn't recreate their powers. It was just mimicing Eso's wings. Eso's wings weren't auto-tracking missiles, remember? Choso was having that emotional boost from the thoughts of his brothers, thats all.

>I agree that it's more likely to be figurative, but I'm curious about your take on this part of their exchange.

I got shit on it for it in the previous thread, but I think Yuji was just thanking Choso for giving the FetusBros a funeral. That was one of Choso's reasons for going to the Tengen Storage in the first place. 
I think its a super dumb idea that Choso would go to give them a proper burial, NOT do it while waiting for Kenny, then decide after the Kenny fight to just go "you know what, I'mma turn my bros into a snack for Yuji instead".

--- 251339111
>>251338552
There's aren't popular ones, but ones I've seen that I think are interesting. (There is a seemingly common thought that Gojo is fucked against a Sukuna who has the Ten Shadows because of Makora.)

1. Remember original versin of the Bath that Kenjaku mentioned? Putting a bunch of venomous creatures inside pot, and they eat other, concentrating their poisons, increasing the poison's potency, into a single surviving creature. Then the taking the remaining liquid(probably blood and gooey flesh bits) filled with CE to use for the Bath. Someone said maybe Yuji is going to eat a on of cursed items, and do that internally. Which will strengthen him into a creature like Sukuna.
The idea being that Yuji was never a vessel to imprison Sukuna, but a vessel that could BECOME like Sukuna.

2. People were talking about how Makora is too OP for anyone, even Gojo if he doesn't one shot it. And then someone said there's an easy solution for Makora. Its Kashimo. Thats where his CT is going to be useful. Not against Sukuna directly, but he'll use it on Makora, fucking it up.

3.Joke scenario.
>Gojo: Kept you waiting, Megumi.
>Sukuna: So you've come, Gojo Satoru.
>Takaba: Haha, doesn't Sukuna have no cursed energy?
>Gojo: NOW! Domain Expansion!
>Sukuna: Domain Expa- wait, where is all my cursed energy?
>Gojo: I'VE WON!!
And so Sukuna was defeated.

4.Megumi going to mess with Sukuna causing either Sukuna to split off to someone else, or Sukuna dies alongside Megumi.

5. And interesting point made was: Even if they do kill Sukuna... he's definitely just going to become a cursed item. He knows the method now. 
I kinda like this one. Everyone wins, but we're back to sealing Sukuna cursed items away. The cycle continues. Life goes on.
--- 251339127
>>251338315
That makes sense. That exchange feels like it's touching on Yuuji's guilt over killing Choso's brothers, but I couldn't figure out what the 'thank you' was for since I'd honestly forgotten that Choso wanted to bury his brothers' corpses.
>you know what, I'mma turn my bros into a snack for Yuji instead
I mean, I wouldn't put it past Choso but it is pretty ridiculous. I feel like both the 'as long as they live on inside you' and 'I'll eat anything if it'll kill him' lines are both meant to be read figuratively, but they were intentionally written this way because it's just funny imagining the guy who's been chowing down on Sukuna fingers like they're KFC all series literally eating his way to victory. It just seems like Gege's sense of humor.
--- 251339211
>>251339111
I like the Kashimo one because the idea of his CT being something like an absolutely insane electric discharge that could instantly destroy Mahoraga is cool. Though in that scenario I could just as easily imagine Sukuna realizing the output would be too massive for even anything he has to handle it so he'd just opt to fully evade it
--- 251339399
>>251339111
> There is a seemingly common thought that Gojo is fucked against a Sukuna who has the Ten Shadows because of Makora
I thought that was obvious. Sukuna had realized ages ago he’d be fucked against Gojo. When he saw Megumi he got the idea of using the Ten Shadows against him, and the only known case of someone like Gojo being defeated was against a Ten Shadows user. Gege couldn’t foreshadow this any harder
--- 251339430
I forget, did Gojo ever say poison was harder to reflect with his infinite thing or was that when he was just getting it set up for the first time?
--- 251339520
>>251336002
by manipulating the body (given his heritage is those cursed womb blood fuckers) Yuji can manipulate the soul (the inversion of Mahito's shit where soul affects body).
Explains a lot of the existentialist/essentialist stuff Mahito and Kenjaku chatted about when Geto briefly tried to choke Kenny.

Yuji consumes Kenjaku's new pet.

Gojo loses to 10 shadows Sukuna, especially with Sukuna having the mental game.

Any theories around Angel? I find Angel to be the most mysterious figure so far and yet nerfed in the most terrible host. Are the nips as annoyed by Kurusu Hana as the English speaking fans?
--- 251339836
>>251339111
Last one I saw thats intersting. 

We've all considered this one, probably.
Someone mentioned that Kenjaku is the one who turned Angel into a cursed item, and he's a complete moron if Angel is the one who releases Gojo from the Cube.
Another person replied that one of Kenjaku's goal must be to weaken Sukuna for some purpose. He WANTS Gojo free in the final fight to pit against Sukuna.


Bonus for the lulz:
If Yuji eats: the remaining 5 Sukuna fingers, Ryu's corpse, the Cube. Then he'll be strong enough.
If he eats Nobara, he'll probably get weaker.
--- 251339889
>>251339782
Not as annoyed. They just find her useless. She's really a nothing burger.

As for Angel comments, outside of what I posted here >>251339836, its nothing worth mentioning. Just commenting on the chapter. No theories.
--- 251339947
>>251339836
Well now that you mention it. Maybe Kenjaku wants to use the CE that would be unleashed from a Gojo v Sukuna battle as battery/to power his merger with Tengen?
--- 251339955
>>251339836
I saw this prediction recently:

>>251339947
>Maybe Kenjaku wants to use the CE that would be unleashed from a Gojo v Sukuna battle as battery/to power his merger with Tengen?
The whole point of the Games is to generate enough CE to power the merger, though. Kenjaku has already flooded the entire country with CE. So I don't think thats the case.

I think if he's got Sukuna plans, its probably another experiment to run. Tengen is the primary one right now, Sukuna is another one. There was that line about 'tengen looking like Sukuna, when Kenny first saw Tengen's current form. There's an implication there that Sukuna is an "evolved" human. Maybe its got to do with that.

>>251339955
Haven't seen it recently, but I remember this being mentioned back when the rear gate was first revealed. Would be a hell of a twist.
--- 251340270
>>251339526
So he's probably mastered poison by this point too. Just wondering since he still reacted to smoke when fighting Jogo. I bet Sukuna has some kind of poison technique up his ass, but it probably don't matter against Gojo.
--- 251340335
>>251340270
>. Just wondering since he still reacted to smoke when fighting Jogo.
It wasn't smoke, iirc. It was the sonic attack from Jogo's bees.
Which makes sense. He can hear stuff, so sound has to go through. (Which opens up a whole thing about mechanical waves interacting with the auto-shield, but lets not go into that.)
--- 251341125

--- 251343630
We won't get a proper Heian flashback but it'll be covered briefly in snippets kiek we've been getting and in kenjakus flashback. 
Also I think other 2 mummies which haven't been shown (we've seen tengens and sukunas, 3rd one is possibly kennys and 4th one is ???) will come into play
The cursed monster from the merger will work more as a third party within the final fight. 
Sukuna will end up being like Fortuna from Spirit Circle, meaning he won't be a malevolently evil person but someone who thinks he's above humanity and values CE evolution and seeing where it'll go over people's life's and his freedom to research is the most important thing to him and probably why he sticks kenjaku and Yuji will obviously kill him. 
Kenjaku will be Tengens apprentice and later friend and will probably be the big flashback we've been anticpating. A difference in opinion will force tengen and Kenny to go separate ways, possibly on their thoughts on reincarnation, tengen feeling that the star vessel approach is more humane while Kenny favouring the hjacking the host. Their friendship and breakup will mirror geto and gojos. All 4 will die together with it basically ending in a 3v1 of geto, tengen and gojo vs Kenny.
Hajime will probably do the most significant damage to sukuna based on how he's been built up but ultimately die.
Getos old squad will come back in some fashion, maybe in the final fight vs the cursed monster
Yuji will probably kill Megumi
Rika (permanently this time), Hajime, Hakari, Choso and most of the kyoto crew bar Kamo will die
Nobara is braindead right now but will become part of the reason Yuji decides to keep moving forward.
Barriers will go down by the series end and Yuji will become a worldwide homeless cursed hunter while Yuta, Kamo and Maki becomes the new head of jujutsu thing.

>>251343685
Its a guess. There are 4 core Brahma Barriers, right? One of them had Tengen's sleeping body, the other one we just found out had Sukuna's mummified corpse. So there's a theory that the other two Brahma Barriers also have bodies there.
--- 251343955
>>251343685
In the last chapter kenjaku mentions 4 area where there is a 4 powerful barriers. 1 of them is star palace where kenjakus mummy was in the tree while kenjaku went to another area which were caves to pick up sukunas mummy. Not for certain that the other two areas have mummies in them but just speculation since the 2 areas we've seen have 2 of the strongest sorcerers we've seen.
If I was to speculate further I think one mummy will either be kenjaku orginal body or Yuji ancestor which sukuna alluded (which I think will end up being a cursed spirit that ate curses to grow stronger and Sukuna fought with it at some point) while I think the other will end up being angels orginal body

He didn't really struggle, but also wasn't the rule change with the point introduced before he fought. He wanted to kill the cockroach but I think he found common ground with the other 2 and didn't really want to kill them.
Also yuta is clearly weaker than sukuna but I don't think that should be suprising

Ranking 
>Shibuya
>Enter Mahito 
>Cursed Womb
>Gojo/Geto backstory
>Todo scenes
Are the only good parts of this manga, excluding the last string of chapters. To be fair, JJK has been mostly great but the culling games arc as a whole has sucked.

These things are basically written in stone, obviously not everything, but the general idea:
>Yuji will get Kenny/Sukuna-lite powers and this is how he'll defeat him in the end, after Ken kills a bunch of the cast. Yuji survives obviously, but Ken's death will be bittersweet as he'll redeem himself someway, or save a fan fav character. 
>Gojo will fight Sukekna, with both of them being sealed away/killed forever. Somehow 6 Eyes is traded for the King of Curses, because this is star wars or something where the good guys are in absolute control but it's balanced apparently. Kekna will most likely live on in some way but will be written off in the end in a hack/BS kind of way but their fight will be good.
>Yuta and Hakari will basically have the same ending as they are basically the same character with a slightly different flavour. So they both die or both live to become jjk tech teachers. Bonus points if Hikari becomes a gambling tycoon owner and Yuta finds happiness or something and fully gets rid of his CE
>Choso is obviously dying, Panda honours his father with principal gakawhatever and they start the reformation process of the conservative faction and it's all good, also they build a memorial for Gojo and Nobara and David Bowie and whoever else died
>Maki will head the new Zenin clan and somehow all institutional problems are saved by a powerful woman. The toji plotline will have no significance as his aesthetic has been bastardised and his entire point will be lost on Gege by the ending 
>Noritoshi heads his clan, and it will be as boring as his entire character is. 
>Todo reduced to JJK tech teacher fodder for some reason

--- 251345065
>>251345024
>The final panel is of the sky, and the slowly rebuilt JJK tech is the location of it. A solemn Yuji remembers how Megumi told him to live on, and his grandpa or some shit who also turned out irrelevant. Yuji is the exact same character as he has been post cursed womb arc, a crybaby poofter who dragged down a pretty decent series and would be WOAT candidate if Sukekna wasn't there to carry him on his tired back.

This is one of the biggest shames of the zenin arc. Some sort of explanation or insight into the reason for heavenly restriction existing would be nice. Only cope I have is that it'll be half explained in some other flashback or its orgin will be discussed in a throwaway conversation
--- 251345776
Uh huh. Uh huuuuuh!
--- 251345779
>>251345024
You've listed basically 2/3rd of the manga. I thought all of the junpei arc was good and really set the tone of the story going forward. The yaga chapters were good if a bit short, would've liked him to have a bit more an arc especially since I think Kenny will use something similar to his technique. In the culling games, I thought higurama and hajime vs Hakari were really good, the latter probably being my 3rd favourite fight of the series.
I have misgivings about gege, especially the zenin arc and rule chapters in the culling games seeing as they literally don't matter but overall jjk has been a fun ride

--- 251346396
>>251345204
Heavenly Bindings are never going to be explained, anon. Its a natural phenomenon, like people being born with CTs. The answer to "why" is 'cursed energy'. And trying to delve any further than that is like asking why does cursed energy strengthen bodies, why can curse energy be formatted into mentally created formulas to create various effects, why is it possible to summon shikigami, and on and on. 
Any "source" explanation is going to just be an explanation of why cursed energy is a thing in the first place.

I still think Gojo's role is going to bringing Megumi back out of mindbreak mode by telling him about Toji and shit with a TnJ moment. Then Yuji will land the lethal blow, and Megumi in control will prevent Sukuna from healing up and die. Mirroring Yuji's death at the start of the manga.

--- 251348533
>>251347444
It doesn't have to be dogshit, but you have to set it up properly. Wheel of Time actually does a pretty good job with this trope, but it's set up from the very beginning that this story is just one battle in an endless cycle and a lot of the story revolves around the characters both realizing that and reaching enlightenment around being stuck in reincarnation hell.
JJK has the thematic foundation for being cyclical (it's literally called 'returning' or 'cyclic' battle) but hasn't touched on it much at all.
--- 251349264

>Those little broskis
I feel like they barely knew each other. There weren't enough interactions for me to buy into the "main trio" dynamic.

can someone remind me of the reason why Todo hasn't gotten his arm back yet? did idle transfiguration permanently fucked him up to the point where not even reverse ce can heal him? and if that's the case then why can't he get a cursed tool prosthesis or something?
--- 251349586
>>251349290
Idle Transfiguration permanently alters the soul. Todo no longer has an arm to get back. Also he could get a prosthetic but it likely wouldn't allow for him to use Boogie Woogie as the activation requires two actual hands to clap. He should still use it in tandem with a partner though at least

Hidden in juju scroll, the occasional SoL moment, extra material (like the one where they play at an arcade together and stalk Gojo to a maid cafe) flashbacks and implied/unseen shenanigans sadly. I can definitely buy Megumi and Yuji as close friends, though, just how they act and seem to be able to read eachother/want to defend eachother.
--- 251350004
>>251349705
does it really matter? we've seen that you can deal with sorcerers (and curses to some extent) with normal weaponry.
hell, i'd even bet that you can deal with shit like the disaster curses as long as you're willing to bring out the nukes.
the true nipwank is Toji, the only human with zero CE being born in the one country where jujutsu is prevalent.
--- 251350154
>>251350004
It does matter. We just saw that a whole squad of special forces was killed like super easy. Japs are implying that they can easily conquer the world but they didn't because they are too busy with their too powerful country.
--- 251350170
I'm out of the loop, why did Toji attack Gojo and Geto in the past? Is it just pure "So you both are called the strongest and I'm mentally ill so I will kill both of you)"?

Did you forget what you read? He stomped them in order to collect the bounty on Amai, but got a huge suicidal urge to keep fighting Gojo after Gojo survived getting stabbed in the head.
You can interpret it easily as Toji wanting to die and leave his son to somebody he hoped was strong and decent enough to keep him safe.

The characters are also dissimilar apart from surface level ‘dark haired pretty boy who is reckless’, so where’s Aki’s ending was sad but appropriate as he was already terminal by choice I’d prefer one where Megumi also found himself veering away from being just as suicidally insane as Yuji instead of relying on immediately summoning Mahoraga when backed into a corner.
Also like Yuji he’s been basing his continued existence on chasing Tsumiki like Yuji was chasing his own death as his end goal. Both of them have had what was keeping them on their current paths eliminated.

he wasn't doing that at all though. she went into a coma, he went on with his life, really. when she needed help he tried to keep her safe, as you would do with family. you're comparing things that have nothing to do with each other, really. what tsumiki was doing, not really her but her role, was to keep "the wolf" domesticated, and act more like a dog. without that influence, his instinct is to pretty much act like his father's son. either way his death flags are as a big as a house

It’s pottery enough. His similarity to Toji in that he wants to preserve the lives of people he loves and that he’s a feral idiot doesn’t mean he’s going to commit suicide via Gojo.
--- 251359470
>>251358702

>saving Tsumiki has always been directly linked to stopping Sukuna since her curse is linked to him
and? 
>when he thought about people he wanted to save, he only pictured Tsumiki and Yuji
that's just a trait, he wants to save those who, in his eyes, deserve it. it doesn't connect to anything you're saying
>when he entered the culling game his only goal became to save her
yeah no shit 2.0. you're much stronger than your sister, who cannot fight. it's a no brainer
>in the same instance Yuji’s endgame of dying to stop Sukuna was shattered, Megumi’s endgame of saving Tsumiki was shattered when Sukuna killed her
this is the only sentence you typed that is relevant. but not in the way you think. his similarity to toji goes beyond what you mentioned, which was displayed during the cg, and when he went after remi afterwards, only for him to stop when "his conscience", of which he believed the physical manifestation was his sis, made him stop. if dying means that sukuna does as well, now that he really has a proper grudge against him, i can totally see him doing it, similarly to what takasugi did in gintama (and it was very well done btw). you want him to live, which isn't wrong, but again there's nothing off about him dying either

I honestly have just been taking this for granted but when I think about it again. Isn't it kinda suspicious that Yuji instantly imprinted on Megumi after meeting just once? And it's not like Yuji's the ONLY good person he knows. All the other students qualify as "good people".

With freeing Gojo being seen as a criminal act from the Jujutsu headquarters, have the remaining Kyoto students now gone rogue since they're now helping to free him? Since Gakuganji killed Yaga as his death was something the Jujutsu headquarters also wanted, could we see him confront his own students? And will Utahime even be shown in this manga again? Besides Todo and Mai powering up Maki and Yuji the Kyoto cast of characters have been utterly squandered. Freeing Gojo could have resulted in a JJK civil war which would have been a good penultimate arc to the series. We would have learned more about the supporting cast of characters we've hardly gotten to see in the series as well how the major clans work and their importance to the Jujutsu society. And even if you don't like the supporting cast, Gege could have killed them off before the final battle so there would be less cannon fodder. But I don't see that happening now unfortunately with Gege hell bent on speed running his series for whatever reason.

Specifically, why did she make a deal with Kenjaku to be reincarnated? She said that reincarnated sorcerers suppressing the consciousness of modern day people goes against her beliefs, but what the hell did she expect? That they'd all be docile, sit pretty as their hosts do fuck all?

The whole thing with his technique is whether he can target things, either manually or automatically, with his tech - but remember, he actually targets HIMSELF to get it to work.

--- 251373371
>>251361761
Tengen could have ended the Culling game on the spot of dissolving the barrier. They chose not to because then all the cursed energy that japan had would spread out to the world and cause mass causalities. Also, going by the naming of the barriers(purification and brahma) its possible that the barriers not only contained the cursed energy but actively suppressed/reduced it.

Secondly, if would set back the Sorcerers' knowledge and capabilities of barrier techniques a thousand years.

I've been randomly updating people but forgot to update this place as well. Highlight recently is in an attempt to reduce PS file size by changing the file mode from RGB to gray scale, it flattened 30 pages of my files. Got depressed from that. Scanlation of JJK is truely just cursed. At least I got to use my newly learned TSing skill for the current leak fanscan. (So if leak fanscan is alive, I'm alive)
--- 251379874
>>251378342
Oh another thing is it's been pointed out that I cannot be trusted to spell correctly. So I spent a while transcribing the pages into a google doc to spell check. Also the flattened files meant I can't open an older file to grab sfx or font setting that I had and I have to re adjust the fonts and setting again ;-; Also was sick the last 3 months. I'm just now showing signs of recovery. I don't think I can hit my original goal of HI arc before S2. Too many setbacks after setbacks.

The army subplot feels incredibly pointless now. Fair enough if they were there to facilitate more deaths but it doesn't even feel like that matters anymore since kenjakus parameters seems to extent beyond the radius of the colonies for some reason and it feels the army will just contribute to being fodder vs kennys cursed merger monster thing.
It would've been better if a task force was formed due to spread of curses throughout japan due to the shibuya incident and we're a legitimate threat due to modern weaponry and insanely precise tactical maneuvers vs what basically amounts to superpowered children.
--- 251382807

Yea, that wasn't done well. I was so ready to see the group vs swat team but it was totally skipped.

--- 251387761
>>251387436
With that logic JJK is just Naruto, since Gege explicitly drew inspiration from it.
Oh wait, Gege also draws from HxH, so I guess JJK is HxH.
Oh wait, JJK draws from Buddhism. So I guess JJK is just Buddhist texts.

i'm sorry you can't read, but i can't take responsibility for that. i simply said that if bleach is michael bay, then so is jjk, since it's heavily inspired by it and very very similar. not once i said it was replicated kek. just stop, you're pretty much arguing with me over something you think i said.

It was already explained that RCT takes a huge toll on shoko. She already took the time to restore hakari's arm and she isn't special grade so it's not like she has an infinite amount of CE. I genuinely don't get how the fuck people like you are so confident in being speedreaders.

It will be the funniest thing ever if Gege finishes the manga without saying another peep about Nobara and people are just in denial saying "she's recovering" until Gege confirms in an interview 5+ years from now like "what? yeah she died, what part about getting her face blown off didn't click with you guys, did you really think she was alive all this time?"

With the rule that forces no new players I wonder how that will work with gojo being released soon. My guess is that Kenny wants to use that rule to keep gojo out of the barriers. Seems that Kenny can set things up to keep gojo out of the barriers now that having tengen gives him the ability to add any rule he needs. Genuinely one of the coolest set ups and smartest coolest villains I've read in manga.

We will get a Christian ending. Yuji will ingest the filth of the world, he will be pinned to the cross and will eat up its suffering, transmuting it into love.
--- 251410749
>>251410024
To add onto this, it seems like Kenny really only needed gojo out of the picture temporarily. With the ritual and barrier rules in effect if gojo is released he would be forced outside of the barriers and while transportation is allowed between colonies now it's only for players. If tengen dies and the barriers are destroyed then we are transported back to hell on earth but the only way to end the CG is to kill megumi and Kenny which would honestly be slightly feasible with megumi back on the good guys side. With the current line up the biggest power houses are Yuta, Hakari, comedian (if he has learned to use his technique), yuji (power boost TBD but hopefully stronger punches and kicks), maki (my wife), Mei Mei (until she runs out of crows) and choso. I genuinely want to believe that these characters could win but it's not looking good and a bad ending for this story would make me happy.

You can swap players with Meguni's rule though right?

The no player rule would out rule that, it's a bug rule on purpose anon. That's the whole point.

Read his fight

It'd be more accurate to say that it doesn't matter because there is no reasonable way to gain 100 points anymore

There are still CS that can be hunted or they can start killing other players which obviously won't happen but it's one of their options. Did I miss a confirmation on all the other players being dead? Pretty sure gege didn't off screen every other player besides the main cast

Well, since I can't complain in the chapter thread because you dinks let it die instead of this one...

>Barring new players from participating
makes it seem like people can still join, just not play. 
>a better barrier
Better than what, Werry? Shouldn't use comparatives when you haven't set an antecedent
>>251403806 →
>This barrier vs these barriers
Makes it seem like the game is solely based on the one barrier, but ending the game would require dispelling all four. Dumb.
>Reclaim
All translations I've seen for this line feel unnatural, though the underlying meaning is clear. I'd have gone with something like, "sorcerers would be reduced to using barrier tech from 1000 years ago," but I'm EOP, so I can't say how close that hews to the nip.

>>251403855 →
>Many people would have died, but Tengen bet they would win. 
Werry sure loves confusing antecedents, doesn't he? This time his mistake makes it seem like the people who died would win! Huh!

>>251403908 →
See, HERE he translates it in a normal way, so was he just being retarded on purpose?

>>251403970 →
>Because then the barriers for ritual merger with you...
Just awkward

>>251404088 →
>Yes, and
Should be "yes, but" in English

>>251404147 →
>Splud
...acceptable, lol. Is he trying to cover his "whud" mistake from earlier?

>>251404199 →
>Stopped
Also not what you'd say in English. "Stopping" is usually reserved for confrontational situations, not for salvific ones.
>I need to ask... Kurusu can't fight
Awkward again. A natural way to fix this would be to change it to, "I need to ask, SINCE Kurusu can't fight."

>>251404263 →
>Speaking from experience,
Completely unnecessary and sounds stupid. It's definitively possible, it's just that ANGEL doesn't know how. 

>>251404372 →
>The culling game scared me too
Unbelievably small nitpick, but there should be a comma before "too." This page's translation was pretty clear English, though. Credit where due; good job, Werry.

>I was in love with one of you...
This panel seemed to give everyone issues, so I can't be too hard on the guy, but my take would have been, "BEING in love with one of you... That's something that never ever would have happened TO ME, even if the world was turned upside down."

Better than I thought he was gonna do. I also feel weird about the pure/bon barrier translation situation, but Gege didn't make that easy on anyone by dumping two new related terms with subtle cultural meaning in the same chapter.

predict his fight vs everyone (unless Yuta, Yuta will go for Kenny)

>>251416714
Tangent, I want Kenjaku to get completely btfo'd by a team of Yuta, Kamo, and Miwa, the three people he's utterly disrespected. Nothing would please me more.
