I just want something that can cast my desktop video and audio to a remote TV on the network. How fucking hard is that, in the year of our lord 2023?

Chromecast worked for this for a year, until some recent update fucked it and now it plays the video at half speed (but audio at full speed), which shouldn't even be possible. VLC doesn't fully support casting to chromecast based devices any more because Google keeps trying to disable PC to chromecast streaming for anything not developed by them. Miracast doesn't work at all, doesn't seem to be compatible.

How do I actually get this to work? What do I need to buy or install on my TV so I can cast desktop video and audio to it? This is fucking insane, everything is locked behind a walled garden, and the walled garden I happened to pick fucking broke and now there's nothing.

CPU loads stuff onto and from the drive and onto and from the RAM.
If the drive is slow (like an HDD) it will be really fucking slow to load anything, and slow to boot.
CPU matters less to a certain extent but contributes a lot to speed.
If there is insufficient RAM space it's really bad because you'll start using the drive in place of it and if that's an HDD it's super slow.
Super fast RAM only really matters for gaymer garbage, for a work computer whatever is in there should be fine.

You said HD space so the cheapest and best upgrade is an SSD.

I have a home desktop with a 144hz 1080p HDMI/DP monitor, keyboard, mouse. It's about 6 years old and only has USB-A 3.0, it doesn't have USB-C.

I have a work laptop (Thinkpad X13) with HDMI, USB-C, and some kind of port that Lenovo calls a "Network extension for Ethernet/side mechanical docking."

I want to be able to switch between the laptop and the desktop while using the same monitor/keyboard/mouse and keep the monitor at 144hz. Is there some type of dock/switch I can buy that will do this? 

I thought what I want is a KVM Switch but when I tried looking for one it seems like they are all old niche tech and limited to 60hz HDMI, and the docks that I looked at appeared to only be useful for connecting a laptop to home peripherals, not being able to switch between a desktop and laptop.

> Should I just disconnect any other drives so it's forced to recognise it?
Recognition won't be an issue, but Windows does weird shit with the bootloader / recovery partition when you have multiple drives connected during installation. So just have the boot drive connected for windows installation, then once that's done connect everything else. 

Otherwise you risk your recovery partition being on a different drive. Which isn't the end of the world but it's just another thing to keep track of.

I have a gayman pc that recently started shidding the bed. Was wondering if anyone had troubleshooting insights for me.
Setup:
>5600x
>asus b550 mobo, latest bios stock settings
>rtx 3070 stock clocks
>logitech g pro x superlight
Symptoms:
>game (pubg) runs fine as long as i'm only using the keyboard, when i use the mouse to free look it turns to a powerpoint slideshow presentation on dying in FPS games
>unsure whether the issue is present in other games, pubg is my main game so i've been troubleshooting this for half a day. 
>worsens after extended gameplay
Things I've tried:
>charging my mouse
>changing mousepads
>rollback graphics driver with ddu
>reset bios settings
This started happening shortly after the last update so it could be software related but I don't think it's my cpu. I downloaded ryzen master and did the stress test and it came back ok. If it were my hardware, I think it would be more likely to be the gpu or the psu rather than the mouse itself. Despite how many times I've dropped it, the fact that the issues get worse over time seems to point to heat being the culprit but I am guessing.
I am downloading a fresh copy of windows to install but if I get it fixed without having to resort to that then all the better. Ideas, g/irls?

There is no fucking way I withdrew 200 dollars in cash just to go out and buy a fucking fan/heatsink instead of ordering it online or even buying it with a card. But whatever.

You can pass environment variables in situations where passing a file is harder (containers).
Outside containers, variables are more secure because they are only visible to the process you pass them to, whereas files may be readable by unrelated processes.
Variables also die with the process and leave no traces.

--- 92819288
>>92819211
Yes, there is a way to disable an external video card completely in a desktop computer.

You can disable it through the BIOS settings of the motherboard. The process may differ slightly depending on the brand and model of the motherboard, but generally, you will need to enter the BIOS settings by pressing a key during the boot process (often F2, Del, or Esc). Once you are in the BIOS settings, look for an option related to PCI/PCIe devices or graphics cards. You should be able to disable the external video card from there.

This way no power will be supplied to the video card. This is the only way to achieve this without removing the video card from the slot.

As I understand it, the difference between the AGPLv3 and the GPLv3 is that AGPL specifies that providing remote access to the software (such as via a website) is considered distribution of the software requiring you to provide the source in that situation while GPL doesn't require that. My question is: why is there a seperate license for this clause? Why wasn't that included in the GPLv3 by default?
By extension: why would anyone choose the GPL over the AGPL? Wouldn't it be better to have that extra clause even if it's a program written in C that would probably never be distributed that way? (And wouldn't a VPS be an example of where C software is being distributed in that way?) 
I've read on the FSF website that the AGPL isn't a solution to SaaS but I still don't see why someone would choose to not have that extra clause if they've already decided to release it under the GPL anyway.

GPL was written before someone could take your software, alter it, but never distribute it while still making it available to the public.
Essentially, AGPL closes a massive loophole in GPL that appeared as a result of changing technology.

A bank has some sort of promotion where they'll give me money if I use their credit card several times a month. I'm a basement dweller who doesn't order too much from the internet so I'm afraid I won't use it enough to get the money.
Is there some sort of service that costs extremely little, several pennies or something, that will count as a regular credit card payment? I don't really care what it is as long as it counts as a regular payment.
--- 92826890

Just use your credit card to pay your bills and other expenses you normally use your income for, then use your income to instantly pay off you credit card. You'll build credit (which is kinda of a meme at this point) and get your lol free shit from the bank.

If you have zero income, not even SSI/SSD, then you shouldn't get a credit card. They probably wouldn't (they shouldn't) approve you for one anyway.

I keep getting an issue where waking from sleep/hibernate mode doesn't work. The screen stays black, keyboard input gets no response, etc. When this happens and I go to reboot, the OS will not load on startup. It boots into BIOS menu and says no SSD is being read. Is my SSD just failing? Last time it happened I unplugged it from PSU and plugged back in to get it to work, could there just be an issue with sending power to SSD from the PSU?

Coincidentally, I upgraded to Win 11 around the same time it started. It happens once every few weeks

I've been thinking a lot about how riddled with ads and heavily censored the modern internet is. 
If a group of people each had a little device with applications on it would it be possible for them to form a smaller temporary network, like a little decentralized internet away from googles prying eyes?

I'm not super knowledgeable. But I find it ridiculous how someone else besides me is making money off the data I create when I browse the web. I think it would be a great thing for humanity to find away to use the internet to share things organically less incorporated

>>92830686
If you just want away from spying and ads then all you need to do is stop browsing websites that have those.

If you're concerned about censorship at the service level, then DNS and server providers can still censor the website itself. DNS can be avoided by using OpenNIC domains or connecting directly to IP addresses. Servers can always be self-hosted so nobody else can shut it down (not counting some police raid -type scenario). The server can be easily DDOSed though and it's extremely hard to prevent that without joining the botnet.

If the server is self-hosted and you connect to it directly from the IP, then the only middle man is the ISP. Whether and how much they spy on you is anybody's guess, but that's the best you've got.

If you want an entirely disconnected internet that's separate from ISPs and the current internet, then something like PirateBox is probably the best way to go.

Yes, but you should never use it because motherboard RAID is fucking awful. Windows doesn't have reliable multi-disk storage in general. The closest you can get is newer Intel boards where they let you use a SSD as a journal device, but that's wasteful and still less reliable than having an on-disk format that doesn't break in the event of a hard reset.
