Yeah for the first time in forever it's a real new studio and not just a splinter for tax evasion. They've attracted some notable talent, I wish I was better at googling japanese it's probably a good story.

Though I guess that's more of a thirsty loli and her slightly less thirsty older brother.

She actually went mad out of grief and produced the isekai in her head in order to cope with the lose of her brother.

just like previous ep, this was more or less stupid.January season was good, and alot of good songs. This April season is clearly the bad of the year, because many good titles are scheduled for July and October,but also because there are many avg. series in it(April, yes).only 3 animes are really worthy of my list, other 12 are clearly lacking, more or less.

Now, returning to IK, it will continue to be avg., worthless mc&amp;horny sis adventures, it can only get worse in the next eps.and if so, will be nr. 15 in my list and will drop from 7 to 6,so just above garbage, barely.

>>251326751
but if he's in a coma, did she actually die in the real life? will he wake up and find her dead?
--- 251326805
Spoilers for ending:
MC is in a coma and not fully dead, that's why he didn't get a cheat skill. Nee-san killed herself for real so she got hers when isekai-ing. At the end he wakes up from the coma back to the real world and has to decide whether to continue living without his Nee-san or kill himself to go back.

for me was better. Many good titles(wont name them), alot of good songs, basically I watched twice every ep.to understand it better.
Now are just avg.series,no song is great so I skip them, eps watched only once and sometimes it's hard that 1 time. Still 3-4 top series, but the rest is so weak and avg.,almost disturbing.And most plot&amp;characters are avg. at most, boring stories and bitchy guys&amp;girls.

Only if you need to live and breathe big sisternium particles. 
Story-wise it's as generic as it gets.
Relationship dynamic is standard brocon sister with brother trying to keep his chastity intact, however it's slightly better in the regard that he actually cares about her and isn't as cold. Much better than the gay Mamako MC. 
Animation is low budget but high passion, they probably handpicked people with onee-san fetishes for this show and just gave them some instant ramen packs.

I think it's because you can interpret the ending as the older sister going insane at the loss of her little brother and the Isekai stuff that we see is just a product of her mind going crazy trying to find someway to be with him.
--- 251346393
Went in with especially low expectations, but it's still pretty damn shit. The most worn-out tropes in the world and unfunny, done-to-death gags. I expected at least some hot incest action, but the nee-san is an obnoxious retard and the MC a standard faggot.

But why the fuck is the animation quality so good? Who decided to go all out for this and why?

Kishida Fumiko....... Too bad that they survived the explosive incident without injury. Remember what Kishida took away from us. Banning porn from Japan by New AV law, banning bikini from anime.

anekibros, the plan to use good animation to lure in fags into the onee-chan camp is working

There should be a collab between Mamako and this.

It is doubly surprising because two episodes in a row animation is absolutely stellar for an isekai. I am now hoping it stays that way all the way to the end and this mogs every other isekai this season.
--- 251351236
>>251350284
It still has to compete with MT for good animated Isekai.
--- 251351518
>>251351236
Not airing this season, doesn't matter.
--- 251351603
>>251351518
Doesn't matter, MT is the golden standard.
--- 251351859

Kills me that the animation is this good with such a shit story. Came for the hot onee-san, stayed for the visuals.

damn, what a shame nobody pick this up

Just read up to the last translated chapter. If someone ends up picking it up because of the anime I hope they know Japanese, because the current translation isn't good.

>tfw they can't afford much post episode 3 so episode 4 onward is claymation with cardboard scenery
--- 251365705
>>251365371
Depends on what you prefer.
Ane Log is a gag series centered around Moya-nee thinking that her brother is into her and her reaction towards it.
DCD is a supernatural battle/mystery manga that does have a sister-like brocon but that isn't the main focus.
The real answer is of course JK Shachiku wo Kau
>>251365647
Based if true

Yes, this is an implication in every isekai. So when they play with those visuals there is both the positive interpretation and the dark one.
--- 251371255
>>251370904
sounds like a skill issue to be honest
--- 251371259

It really isn't

I have three older brothers though. I don't particularly hate them but I would have loved an nee-chan who would hug me when i'm down

That's not science so much as it is just a puzzle for sociologists trying to decide what term you should be using to address her. You should marry her so you can become your own Aniki as well as your ototo-aniki's aniki.

that's onee chans 101, they always end up shorter than you, unless you got unlucky and inherited a bunch of manlet genes
--- 251377933
>>251377668
Not in anime, older = taller.
--- 251378451
>>251377933
That only lasts till late high school. By then, most 17 year old guys should have hit their peak height, which would be taller than same age girls, who hit their peak ~5 years before.
--- 251378823
>>251378451
Explain that to the Japanese.
--- 251379270
>>251378823
They're about 50/50 on that. Most of the time, teenage guys aren't portrayed as tall unless they're thugs(not always) or sportsmen(again, not always).

--- 251388917

source? If true then it's unfortunate that it was limited to 'tried' and not fully assassinate / kill with -d / -ed
--- 251390087

>>251378823
>>251386577
It's mostly a stylistic thing
