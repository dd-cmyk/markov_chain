You know it will be. Haha.
--- 251325681
>>251325036
I doubt it. Elfs, Humans, Half-foots, Dwarfs and Gnomes are a part of the same race due to their physiology being altered with the Lion's wish granting power. Orcs, Onis, and Lycanthropes are seperate entirely. 

I think there was a page detailjng the number of bones each humanoid Dungeon Meshi species have.

I like Laios is staring at the fairies rather than the elves. Thinking about how they taste I imagine
--- 251325856
>>251325681
Why not?
We have Marcille, who is a Half-Elf, so it wouldn't be to crazy for there to be hybrid species between the races. Also, I don't think the Orcs would have suggest Laois marry what's his face sister if they didn't plan on him procreating with her

And according the Lion, everyone started out as one race, but due to magic split off into all these different sub species

--- 251326117
>>251325681
It was never stated beastmen were not also just wish altered humans, and hybrid viability seems random. Tallmen x elves produce mules, but tallmen x halffoots are fertile for whatever reason.
--- 251326151
>>251322940
I'm thinking the lion's curse is just Laios losing his sense of taste

--- 251326759
>>251326151
>I'm thinking the lion's curse is just Laios losing his sense of taste
I hope so, not being able to bring Falin back would be too cruel plus if she will be brought back she still will be some kind of hybrid form than fully human so maybe it will also expand her lifespan to dragonkind to be matching Marcille long one.
Honestly there's nothing more fitting for Laios to not be able to taste anything where everything even the most tasty thing taste like nothing.

--- 251327131

>Laius was Asterix and Obelix fused in the same character all the time
--- 251327186
I want to take a moment to laugh at all the retarded doomposters from past threads who thought we weren't going to get a happy ending. Get fucked idiots
--- 251327242
Since the residents of the Golden Country can feel the power of the dungeon weakening then Laius should probably entertain the possibility that Farlin might return to normal over time, without having to do a thing. The dungeon turned Yad immortal, the dungeon turned Farlin into a megachicken, if the power of the dungeon fading will end one thing it might also end the second. I guess it is a risky bet since resurrection might also stop working. The worst case scenario would be that Farlin stays the same no matter how long they wait but they lose access to their first strategy.
--- 251327328
>>251327242
More likely she would just die since there's no magic to sustain her chicken form.
--- 251327363

Isn't Farlyn missing a lot of her human side for ress? No legs at all.
A couple pages before they did say magic skill can change the odds tho.
--- 251329022
How will they even cook her
--- 251329032
>>251322611
kek
--- 251329056
>>251329022
Probably a stew to help people forget they're kinda eating a person.
--- 251329101
>>251324915
I kinda want to see more of the world outside the dungeon. Like seeing different towns, interactions between races above ground, etc... dunno what should be the plot, but since the plot of dungeon meshi was so simple, i doubt that matters a lot.

I usually don't like them this fat but this really works for me
--- 251333090
I've been stuck at 50/50 on how the Falin situation shakes out for a long time now because there were signs for both her passing and for the feast, but even now that the feast seems imminent, I still can't stop feeling like both are equally likely. Something just feels weird, and I mean more than just the curse. I'm fully confident Mithrun and Thistle will have closure, but are they really going to not be included in the all-character feast? I'm surprised their issue doesn't seem to be getting resolved first because the Falin thing is more major and you'd usually save that for the big finale. And then, why did Laios becoming human happen suspiciously off-screen, and why hasn't he acknowledged what the lion said at all? Not even internally? The vibe is just off to me. Maybe I'm overthinking it.
--- 251333115

--- 251333589
>>251328955
I think technically her human portion is all there. They did "properly" ress her as a tallman from just her skeleton before, and then she got transformed into a chimera at Thistle's command thanks to the dragon soul being bound to her. So what constitutes her legs should still be in there, just changed in shaped.
The theory is that eating enough of the explicitly dragon parts should make the dragon soul fuck off, and allow them to ress her in a tallman form again. Plus hopefully with more and better mages around, and the world currently being saturated in enough mana too sustain the residents of the Golden Kingdom, the success rate of the spell will be as good or better than when Marcille did her risky dark magic.

Most people like the fan tl more and will shit on official. I personally think the fan tl is better but the official is not as bad as people say. My advice is to stick with fan tl unless you prefer physical.
--- 251334313
>>251334140
EHScans version is better even if it made some mistakes in the earlier chapters. The official scans sound a bit clinical (for example, Senshi's dialogue isn't translated with a noticeable accent/casual inflections.), Thistle was mistakenly referred to as a girl when the JP version hadn't yet referred to him by gender, and to this day they're still mistakenly translating Thistles name as "Sissel" and have no inclination to fix it (they even edited their english release of the adventurers bible to fit with their wrong version)

which is just the usual /a/ cluelessness, it's fine

back to the question tho, yeah, fan translation (ehscans) is perfectly serviceable, they do good job. One really has to appreciate that in the MTLshit era we now live in.

--- 251338962
I wonder if magic from the dimension the demon came from is still seeping into their world or if the demon closed everything off in its last moments along with throwing out all the people it took. If it's completely gone that means no more dungeons presumably, natural or man-made. Would that also mean no more monsters?

I don't think the Demon can close it all off since it seemed originally it just kind of leaked through to the physical world. The Demon just found its way through one of the many holes.

At best they probably would want to debrief him and they already joked that Elven Bureaucracy is as long-lived as Elves themselves meaning a lot of people waste most their lives in detention even if they have no intent on actually imprisoning them afterwards. I mean the dude became a God Monster and single handedly defeated a demon in the Shadow Realm. That's worth a sit down.

This is the foreshadowing that ends the story on a dark/sad note 
The lion/demon imprinted the same kind of endless drive to consume that it had to every character that got taken into his void
They'll be able to eat all the dragon meat but lack the self-control to stop, leading to either gorging themselves to the point of bloating or attacking each other for more meat

It's going to be full immortality with that loss of taste. He'll have to watch everyone die eventually, which is why Marcille's greatest fear has been so hyped upon in the story, and live on and on never needing to eat or able to taste. Even if this plan works he'll lose Falin eventually and never able to join her even in death. It's the worst possible fate for him.

Not quite, he'd still have Marcille to hang out with for a while and since she's a hyper-talented magic user she could potentially find a way to undo the curse (though whether she would want to do that and watch him die is a different question).
--- 251340146
So it's very obvious that the Lion's final curse is to make Laios lose his sense of taste right?
--- 251340253
>>251340133
That's just going to be the bitter dessert to it all. It will reverse her own personal tragedy in that she'll have someone to be with her for her entire existence and think she'll have hundreds of years to figure out a solution but also feel secretly guilty in that Laios' loss is her gain. Then spend the last few hundred getting more and more desperate when she can't find a way to reverse it, making Laios feel even worse when she finally dies in complete despair and bitterness. Everything just works out to ultimately maximizing his misery. It's literally the biblical Curse of Caine upon him.

I hope not. At the very least Kui is going to have to flex her writing bone more magnificently than ever before to execute that in a way that's not disappointing. I don't care that it's a big deal to Laios, I'm not going to be moved by a fictional character losing their tastebuds.
--- 251340577
>>251340253
I really doubt Marcille's problem of being unable to accept that her loved ones will die is going to be resolved by an unnatural solution that defies lifespans when her stint as dungeon lord was all about the folly of pursuing such things.
--- 251340657
>>251340577
It would be a great flavor of irony in that everyone gets a happy ending but Laios. The tragedy that was being hyped up for her is instead visited upon him. And then she'll know exactly what it was like to be her father that she adored so much. It's just too great a satire of an ending.
--- 251340747
>>251340657
Who is actually expecting a tragedy? Some of us are expecting bittersweet at most. A purely bitter ending would serve no purpose other than to be ironic and would make the story feel like a waste of time. I enjoy a good tragedy, but this isn't the manga for it.

Like the fact that Thistle and the golden residents will die soon, theyâ€™re at least happy to have been freed from their never changing world. And hopefully through some tomfoolery they might be able to give Thistle his desires back so he can die with (who he thinks is) Delgal by his side.

So is Mithrun going to get braindead now? His only desire was to end demons and now thats it happened I wonder if this desire can change into something else or, if fulfilled it vanished completely. It would be a shame not to give him happy ending I loved this elvish nigga like you wouldn't believe

--- 251345594
>>251345110
No, the fact that he had one desire left more or less allowed him to keep his consciousness more than others like Thistle. He knows the demon still exists in the other universe at least, so I don't think he'll go catatonic, unless he succumbs to the idea that there's no possible way for him to reach said demon.

As things are, he may kill himself or try some stupid magic shit in order to try and reach the demon. I only hope that Laios and his weird pseudo demonic nature might somehow restore thistle/mithruns desires to them. A bit of a stretch, but its the only way either of them might actually get some closure.

> Also is Thistle a sex toy still?
yes
--- 251345620
>>251345399
I feel like 'leftovers' implies that something that was a previously eaten meal. While they DID eat part of the dragon, it wasn't really the part that Thistle used to mash falins chimera form together, so no.

I just reread the first chapter. They are likely going to make a big soup just like the first chapter and I'm convinced Laios' curse is not being able to taste anything. It would be a callback to the first chapter except this time they're saving his sister but he is unable to taste any more monster cuisine which will be his own bittersweet moment while the island parties on.
--- 251347081

Laios losing his taste would be such a spineless boring 'bittersweet' excuse for the lions curse. it's gotta be something much more substantial in order for it to be worth including, especially considering the pacing here we're potentially looking at a whole nother volume to deal with it + an epilogue maybe.
--- 251347219
>>251347127
It's a manga all about food. What else could be as thematically appropriate as losing the ability to taste?
--- 251347275

--- 251347277
>>251347127
like fucking what, I hear a lot of "it needs to be worse" but no one actually names anything personally worse for him. The entire manga revolves about eating: they lost to the dragon because they didn't have rations, he dragon eat the sister, they eat monsters, they eat the dragon to discover that flesh didnÂ´t return, they defeated the wizard using his knowledge of dragon eating habits, the lion eats desires and was defeated by his desires being eaten... eating consuming and such is the fucking center of everything on this manga, what punishment could be thematically better?
The main joke was that Lois always wanted to eat monsters (because of his obsession with the monster cooking guide) and the rescue was the perfect excuse for it, the idea that eating desires was so delicious that anything else is shit in comparison makes sense.
--- 251347290
>>251347219
I don't know what the best solution would be to this situation would be, but like I said, it'd have to be more substantial and potentially fatal than 'laios' loses his taste', which would be a huge letdown after how ominous the demons curse was, and how that curse was apparently related to his wish of saving Falin, not just eating her. ( the line "you don't have much time left" should probably be expanded upon a bit as well )
--- 251347335
>>251339300
Are monsters largely universal across all dungeons?
--- 251347345

The other option was Failin not reviving but this last chapter about everyone helping to save her doesn't have that vibe at all.
--- 251347355
>>251347277
Just because no one here is a pro writer who could figure out a tragic enough twist that could also potentially be fixed doesn't change the fact that 'laios loses his taste' is a bland and bad fucking idea for how little it affects anything. Laios would be more that willing to accept such a thing as his 'punishment' if it meant that Falin and his friends were safe, it doesn't change anything and its not interesting.
--- 251347379
>>251347345
You're kidding right? If anything this level of lead-up to the meal makes it even more ominous, especially with that creepy cover image.
--- 251347411
>>251347355
>Laios would be more that willing to accept such a thing
He would lose the thing that makes him the happiest in many years. The ending doesn't need to be tragic, just bittersweet. Again, is like you have a grand idea in your head but you can't even elaborate on what it is that you want.

It's not grand to expect something a little more impactful than what is essentially an inconvenience, especially in the face of the fact that the main character would've just saved his sister and returned the world to the status quo. he likes to eat but he likes his sister to be alive on a whole different magnitude.

Laios is a certified monster expert and could probably help the western elves or write books about monsters himself, Chilchuck will retire as we know already, Marcille could probably get some mage job lined up for herself easily or go back to being a researcher now that her studies into demon magic would probably be greenlit, she could probably get a job lined up for Falin too, if she survives. Senshiâ€¦ who knows, maybe heâ€™d become a cook? Try to find places that monsters convene in like natural dungeons? Set up dungeon meshi restaurant?

And Izu goes off on her whatever the fuck adventure without Yaad
--- 251348313
Guys, the lion said to Laius he will never achieve his dream. That means the curse is dedicated to impeding a specific goal, that's why Laius immediately thought about his sister. Therefore we can't be looking at a petty revenge of the likes of Laius losing his sense of taste, that's not something that you could inflict on Laius to prevent a "dream" of any sort. It's something that Laius values, but not dream-related.

More importantly, as we saw this chapter, everything that Laius did was for the sake of saving his sister. If the Lion truly understood what Laius wanted the most, if he had been alive this chapter and heard the speech Laius gave just now, he'd have instantly destroyed Falin's body with the last of his strength. The last two chapters make it 99.99% likely that the Lion incorrectly assumed Laius cared most about his dream of becoming a monster than his goal of saving his sister. After the lion was defeated, Laius was found in human mode next to frozen chicken, and Laius was the most depressed we've ever seen. Most likely, Laius has already identified the curse: he was de-monsterized. It also means the lion failed to curse the right thing: Falin is save-able. In a certain way, the Lion indirectly confirmed it by only referring to one of Laius dreams as impossible.

Losing his monster form would be disappointing for Laios but he'd get over it, you're entirely right, but does the Winged Lion knows that? Let's look back a few chapters.
>your DREAM of becoming a monster
>do you care about NOTHING ELSE but tasting monsters?
The Winged Lion got Laius completely wrong. Laius cares about saving his sister more than anything else in the world but Laius successfully hid that part of himself, and convinced the Lion he truly was nothing but a dummy monster fanatic with petty dreams. The Lion was bamboozled all the way to his grave. He failed to realize Laius' battle plan, and after his defeat, he (most likely) also failed to curse what Laius cared most. Being unreadable was the reason for Laius' clutch victory.

The outter appearance is that of a fattened domestic pig which is exactly that, fattened.

It's one of the only manga on the board with threads that reach bump limit despite not having an anime and the studio is going to be Trigger. It is definitely going to be one of the bigger releases of its season and it is definitely going to get shitposted to death. Even if it wasn't popular, series with much smaller audiences that got an anime release this year are getting trolled at full force, so lack of popularity wouldn't be some shield. All that said, whining just adds to the lower quality posting. People can make good posts to counteract the bad posts or they can shut up and leave if they hate it so much, because the shitposters aren't going to suddenly leave just because you complain about them.

I only like the orc because it doesn't feel so forced and the hobbit by giving its feet a more natural anatomy, but the rest is a disaster, the goblin has a good base by mixing it with a bat (nocturnal animals and who live in caves) but the execution is terrible, the same for the dwarf and the gnome.

And the elves I have always related more to hares or deers, but it seems that this artist mixed them with monkeys for no reason

>>251352950

--- 251358072
>>251357843
Anon's point is it's still relatively minor in terms of saving the world and possibly his sister which would be far more devastating. 
However I think it also be kind of fitting that the Demon whose whole existence was marked by trying to gain eternal taste would see that as the worst curse. Also Laius has said before he liked how hunger is such a base but powerful desire that it helped him not focus on the much messier troubles in his life so it's not as though it won't effect him still.

I don't expect it to be mass-appeal like Cyberpunk, though. It's one of those series that has a bit of a strange premise. I suspect it'll definitely attract the former LWA-watching crowd and Luluco fans, but not as much of the Kill La Kill/Edgerunners/Promare hot-blooded "shonen" crowd, since it's a lot more subdued in energy generally compared to those shows.
--- 251360537

What are they going to do about the cat, anyway?
She joined the party looking for a way to de-cat herself, but if there's barely enough magic left to restore Falin who is significantly less fused with an animal, it doesn't look like they'd be able to do anything about her.
--- 251361544

She's already accepted the beast side of herself since the succubus chapter. She kind of wants revenge on the guy that did it, but that's about it.
--- 251361567
>>251361023
I'm not sure how high she ranks. I originally presumed she was basically the Canary leader and that vantablacks were either a rare/royal ethnicity. Given the penchant for Nobles to ship their spares/problem children off to the canaries My theory was she was a Royal who wasn't in line for the throne who joined the Canaries as a show of good faith from the Royal family. However an anon pointed out that her rank probably isn't that high and nobody seems to respect her authority any ways. She's probably just a random Black Elf.

--- 251362896
The last page of the chapter spells out the final twist: Laios wished more to taste his sister than to save her. Notice how he called Falin's name when confronted with the curse?

The meal will be found unexpectedly delicious by everyone, but Laios will be physically unable to partake in it: he'll either lack the sense of taste or puke it out, revolted. Falin will be saved but Laios will be comically downcast anyway. Mark my words.

I always thought that was a bit off. Nobody can be that desne, especially when half of them are women there. Like, when you find a motherless kitten, you know there are things you need to do to keep it alive, so even if they viewed her as an animal, they wouldn't be like this.
--- 251363752
>>251363285
They were giving her food, she just wasn't eating it.
--- 251363766
>>251363285
They literally refer to her as confiscated goods so maybe most Canaries have an issue humanizing Tallmen.
--- 251364267
>>251345110
Reminder that chunks of Laios' monster are scattered around. Either they make a sidedish out of Laios' monster form and eating it restores lost desires, or the secret to "curing" yourself is to develop a new desire from scratch.

>>251338962
The Demon isn't a discrete entity that came from another dimension. He IS the Plane of Infinity, full stop. The only difference now is that It has basically been lobotomized, therefore It no longer is actively trying to consume the entirety of the Material plane to feast on the desires of its inhabitants for all eternity. Otherwise, magic and the Infinite still work exactly like they have before. Or so it can be assumed.

While Falin probably won't stay a megachicken, I'm gonna say there's a 99% chance that if Falin comes out of this alive (which is pretty damn likely), she's still gonna have feathers and scaly reptile feet at minimum.

--- 251365980
>>251363766
Considering even Milsiril, who actively likes and raises tallmen, doesn't grasp basic things about their biology, I think the idea is that they're generally clueless about other species. Though yeah, there is a running theme of regarding the short-lived more like animals. They gave her the same necessities you would give a pet but didn't understand why she wasn't eating because they couldn't grasp that she was traumatized.

I consider Namari a 10/10, but Namari as a tallman is so stunning that she goes into 11/10 territory. Literally made my breath catch the first time I saw it.
I think its a testament of how talented Kui is as both a writer and artist that she could make me feel this way. I NEVER catch feelings for anime/manga characters- except one time I did a little bit for Ryoko and Satsuki from KLK- and I tend to look down my nose at waifufags as well. So it says a lot when someone can create a character that makes me feel things to such an embarrasing degree. And furthermore, Namari isn't even the only one, Marcille and Pattadol offer some pretty tough competition. Come to think of it, I never really cared for elves before Meshi either. It's such a joy to have so many characters that are so distinct and feel so real and alive both visually and writing-wise.

--- 251370928
>>251370725
Do Orcs eat people in this? They're cool with killing but they never seemed to imply they eat others. I'd imagine they'd carry similar taboos about eating demihumans as other cultures. Like when they slaughtered the Speakeasy they just left the bodies.
Though in general this is a weird situation "come eat my abomination of a sister please!"

They're still an intelligent species so it makes sense they're shocked/wary of the idea of eating another humanoid. 

Even when they kill people in the dungeon they feed them to their wargs, they don't eat them themselves.
--- 251371916
>>251334140
>>251334698
I honestly think EHScans' translation is objectively superior- not only is it generally more accurate and without any major translation errors (like the "Sissel" crap in the official TL), but the dialogue and writing just flows a lot better and is of much higher quality than the rather stilted by-the-numbers official TL.
However, one thing that I don't think gets mentioned a lot is EHScans' stellar typography work. The text is always centered in the word balloons in a way that feels really nice and they use very tasteful fonts. They have a fairly typical sans serif manga/comic font in all caps for dialogue but switch it up with a serif font in sentence case/capitalization for text boxes (I like that one especially) and for other stuff like offhand dialogue or text not in a speech balloon (don't know what the term for that stuff is) they use a handwritten-looking font in sentence case. Each font complements what they're used for really well. They put a lot of love and care into their work and the end result is something so professionally made that, frankly, they should be getting paid for it.
--- 251372278
>>251370725
>>251370928
I think that, generally, any sapient species with the ability to empathize and that are sufficiently civilized would probably have issues with eating other sapients. Orcs here are altogether very humanlike and despite their society being somewhat barbaric, are not complete savages.

All I want is for the anime to not be bad. So many adaptations in the past few seasons have been of a much lower quality than expected. Isekai Oji-san was great, but that had Sega backing it officially so that's no guarantee for Dungeon Meshi.

This, I'm very worried about how they'll deal with the pacing as well, given that a fair few of the earlier chapters are just short monster meal of the week type romps without much story. I worry that the anime might just try and rush past that stuff in order to get to the meatier parts of the plot.

Also concerened for the audio side of things, I hope the OST and the VA cast aren't super generic.
--- 251373456
>>251373302
I know people love the early stuff but I feel the later stuff is better suited to animation. I'm more worried they only focus on the part that's meals which is just kind of the same thing over and over again.

>>251373456
I like the later plot driven stuff a bit more myself as well, but that doesn't mean I want the early stuff rushed, it feels really fitting in the manga as their first slow stumbles into the realm of monster eating, and the little details explain a lot about how the dungeon works + what the group dynamics are like. If they're just speedily covered I feel like it'll deprive anime-onlys from getting a good base feel to/understanding of the story before shit starts hitting the fan.

The problem is that Trigger is a tiny studio that can generally only do one big project a year and the staff is already committed to doing other stuff after this, so realistically we are getting one season of this.

Eh, I think 13 would work, end on Falin being resurrected and the ominous introduction of Thistle/Falin climbing out the window at the end, perfect cliffhanger type thing for the next season (hopefully)

Call my hopes misplaced, but I personally trust TRIGGER with this series. Gridman and Dynazenon, for as small of projects as they were, ended up being surprisingly heartfelt and emotional.
That being said, I think they'll really need to lean on their multiple directors to properly pull it off, since the early SoL stuff and the action oriented stuff would be suited to different direction styles. At least Dynazenon/Gridman prove that they as a studio are able to switch between multiple without killing pacing.

Overall I just hope Yoshinari is the one leading direction since LWA is the closest thing to this that they've done prior, especially cour 1.

Orcs are seen as almost monsters due to existing prejudices, and so these prejudices spread and cause others to hunt them, causing them to lash out. They ultimately want to be left alone, which is why they made their home in the dungeon. They didn't WANT to, but it's the only place they could reasonably have their own territory without being raided by adventurers.

Despite this, they're still a sapient people with morals and beliefs, and cannibalism goes against those beliefs.

garfield isekai is kinda jarring in contrast where the MC just sets aside his reservations and cooks n eats orc meat even though they're intelligent enough to build huts and make tools n weapons

about two months ago, a garfield strip seemed to imply that garfield is an isekai protag (of course, not in those actual terms, but same difference)

I can't emphasize more how i wanna buy vegetable Thistle and use him as a cumrag on a daily basis
--- 251386953
>>251385578
If I remember right it's the goblins that make huts and tools and weapons, the orcs didn't show more signs of intelligence than most of the other monsters they ate. Still pretty messed up how readily he agreed to cook humanoids, a strong contrast with Dungeon Meshi where everyone naturally objects.
--- 251387032

I wonder where Thistle is now. Maybe he's gonna wake up desire-damaged and become best no-feelings buddy with Mithrun?
--- 251387123
>>251387032
I'm pretty sure the demon sucked him clean of any desire so the only place he belongs is being a public toilet
--- 251387247
>>251386953
>the orcs didn't show more signs of intelligence than most of the other monsters they ate
I might be misremembering the huts but the orcs definitely had clubs, clothing, and I'm 80% sure at least one had a stone axe
--- 251387827
>>251387247
Yep, I now vaguely remember some loin clothes and cavemen weapons, but nothing like a village, which I remember as more of a goblin thing. Some of the monsters in that setting can reason and talk so the orcs didn't stand out as particularly smart. Still messed up how quickly he accepted to cook humanoids but objected to cooking a poisonous fish. Anyone would be more willing to cook food they can't eat themselves than humanoids.

I think Miyajima is almost certain and I can't wait for them to announce the staff already. At the very least so people could shut up about Imashi and his style.

Looks fine to me. Even the lowest quality Dungeon Meshi transparency edit is 10/10 repost material anyway, people would have whipped up a better version if it mattered. What is it about Dungeon Meshi that makes transparency edits so good? Mystery. It's like the art style is perfect for it.

I don't see that point at all, the first few chapters have more of a focus on food, sure, but there's still the clear goal of saving Falin from the dragon's belly. It's not like it's a SoL
