Is there any headphone worth getting below $1000 besides the HD600?
--- 92800204
>>92799094
Yeah. What do you want? A regular harman target headphone? Look at the sundara or its small brother, the he400se. You are going to need a strong amp to run them, though. Vintage AKG 240s are great, DT 770s are great, the Meze 109 pro are awesome and many others that I have no experience with.
If you dont want to follow the target, either because you are going to use it to listen to specifc types of sound (which is a point of failure of the harman target/IEF methodology as it tries to achieve the average listening experience) or you follow an subjectivist philosophy, there's a ton of shit. Notoriously, Grados and its knockoffs.
--- 92800355
I have an Audeze LCD-XC 2021 and connect it to iFi iDSD nano BL, a DAC/amp I used for IEMs previously. It seems to just work (volume knob at about 1 o'clock) with the LCD-XC, but I wonder - would there be an improvement if I used a more powerful amp? The guy who I got them from shilled so many powerful amps and even some cables that would improve the sound, but I kinda think he drank the hifi koolaid and just rides on the wave of placebo
--- 92800369
>>92799094
you can cop used Sennheiser HD 800/800s or Focal Clear OGs and you're set for life and might not even spend the full 1k. could be further improved by equalizing - AutoEQ or just manually to your liking

--- 92800443
>>92800355
I've never tried any audeze, but, from my experience with hifimans, you can EQ the shit out of planars. If you get a powerful amp you will be able to set up a preamp of 20db with no issue. But all you need is 1w@32ohms. This means a JDS atom, SMSL C200, topping DX3 or D/E30 and similar amps or amp/dacs. You could probably even get away with something like a DX1, Fosi Q5 or a Fiio K7 (dont, though. the K7 is trash for the price). The Dac X6mk2 can probably run them just fine, but it is not transparent and has some nasty harmonics.
--- 92800509
>>92800443
I already EQ the shit out of everything I own cuz free audio improvement. i think the ifi i have is 400mw @ 32 ohm but on audeze site it says recommended wattage is 250 mw, so i guess no need to upgrade?
--- 92800538
>>92800204
>sundara
>harman target
--- 92800704
>>92800538
Yes, it fits the (unsmoothed) harman target very well if you EQ the bass 15db, which is quite possible and expected on this headphone. Your point? 
>>92800509
If the amount of preamp you add in the EQ is plenty in the setting that you like, you dont get audio clipping and it is not terribly quiet, sure, you are good to go. But the IFI zen dac is not transparent, so there's that. As for the cables and shit like that, they wont improve the audio quality. You may want them for a better feel or form factor (straight head vs flat head, braided, stiffness, etc) but the default ones ought to be perfectly fine.

Does vinyl really sound better?
--- 92802153
Yes, hello.
I would like one advice, please.
My previous speakers were Creative GigaWorks T40 Series II, and honestly I loved them, barring one small issue with their "power saving" feature (after some time it goes to sleep and when you play music, the sound only starts after like 4 seconds). I could buy them again, but maybe there is something better for similar price? My only requirement is the size, I don't have much space on my table.

Also there are none of the options from the op available in my country.

That's GenX retard. Learn the difference.

>>92796469
Slim but never zero.

>>92796793
Unlikely. Make sure all cables have a good connection, wiggle a bit. There always will be a faint hiss if you put your ear to the tweeter, but it should not be noticeable when you sit in listening position and normal volume without signal.

>>92797952
Nature is healing?

The market platform removed the listing and sent me a message that the seller was a fraud, i shouldn't give out any infos.
Sad thing is, the seller was in my city, i would obviously seen that there are no Genelecs when he would not wanted me to collect them.

>>92801157
I got these recently, they support LDAC, have low distortion so they are easy to EQ, the noise canceling works. They also have a nice android app where you can EQ to taste. Price is around $100.
https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/1more-sonoflow-nc-headphone-review.42849/
Only con so far is that i haven't seen a source for replacement ear pads.

>>92801532
Vinyl sounds better than nothing, but worse than any other source except 8 track maybe. You don't buy vinyl for it's sound quality (well some retards do, god bless their stunted brains), you buy it because you have nostalgia for it or just to collect it.
Check out the first few Youtube links in the previous thread, there is a great film about record collectors and their autismo.

Any other cheap fucks around here?
I've been using my Sennheiser HD 201 for almost 20 years but they started to look like they were picked straight from a dumpster so I decided to get new stuff.
I got the HD 599 on sale for 68 bucks and pic related, Fosi Audio DAC for 35.
Now I'm missing some new speakers. I've seen the Edifier R1280T being recommended on the 100 bucks range but they seem more oriented to general use instead of music, the Presonus Eris 3.5 caught my eye but I had to return them to Amazon twice.
Any other suggestions? I saw the Dali Spektor 2 brand new for 239 and I could stretch my budget, but I'm not sure if pairing that kind of speakers with a chink DAC is considered retarded.

That would be an immense step up from Edifiers, a friend has them, i like them very much.
Next thing you are looking for a Japanese amp from the 90ies.
You can continue use your DAC, there is no problem in mixing stuff.
How do you drive the Dali Spektor 2? Do you have an amp? Or does the Fosi has an amp built in?

Doesn't seem to be much money, what did you pay, $50? Even if they are crap, send them back, gift them to something, or just use them in the garage or garden. Don't overthink it, if you have damaged hearing you might not detect the difference anyway.

What receiver should I buy for my 5.1 home theatre speaker setup? Denon AVR-X250BT? Denon AVR-X580? Denon AVR-S660H? Onkyo TX-SR393? Yamaha RX-V4A? Yamaha RX-V385? Marantz NR1510?

I haven't actually bought the speakers yet, but I was thinking of starting with some Q Acoustics Q3030i Bookshelf Speakers (maybe Q3020i if I feel like saving money). Down the line I might check out getting some Polk XT60s/XT70s, then changing the Q Acoustics from front to side channels. Also considering JBL Stage A130s but they're not discounted right now (Q3030i is). Haven't decided on a sub or centre channel yet.

My visual hardware will include a Samsung QN90B 4K TV, Nvidia Shield 2019, PS3/4/5, Windows 11 PC (probably not an HTPC, more of a gaming desktop)

Home theatre surround sound is obviously the first priority. Second priority is music.

What is the general consensus on running dual-sub? Is it worth paying a premium for 5.2 over 5.1? Does it depend on the room or something?

Is virtualized Dolby Atmos a meme? I notice a lot of receivers promote it as a feature. I don't even know if they're allowing the upfiring front speakers or if they're using some hacky method to make the standard 5 channels *emulate* ceiling speakers.

I just realized half the receivers I listed don't support HDR10+ passthrough. That just won't do, it's the only worthwhile HDR format my high-end Samsung TV can play.

Anyone wanting to hear the difference between what a fairly affordable (&lt;$1000) setup of speakers, amp and dac can do versus something like the Logitech Z-5500's just setup your PC for WASAPI digital output to both with foobar2000 and then play a track like Vika and Linda's cover of Many Rivers to Cross. The amount of detail that gets lost in the Logitech's is tragic. But they're still an absolutely brilliant budget 5.1 setup.

JBL Stage A130 mentioned in the sticky is a known good budget speaker. I have seen it go for like $150 CAD ($110 USD) on sale in my area.
--- 92808207
>>92805806
I'd wait for the A130. Especially if you're going to move them to surrounds at some point. They're much cheaper and that money can go towards a subwoofer. You can backorder them on Crutchfield. I only had to wait a month or two for mine a couple years ago.
Get the Yamaha RX-V4A. When in doubt and on a budget looking for a receiver, buy Yamaha.
2 subwoofers are totally worth it if you're not using one nearfield or if more than one person is listening. Rythmik is pro tier and you pay a bit more for that. SVS, HSU, and RSL have very good budget-minded options.

--- 92808744

--- 92808903
>>92808744
Yeah, isn't it perfectly viable to use bookshelf speakers for the Front L/R? I was thinking of starting out with that, and by the time I eventually pick up some heavy hitting floorstanders, I could delegate my bookshelf speakers to Surround L/R.

I think the Q3030i Bookshelfs are mainly geared for music though. I don't see anything in the official product page about being used for home theatres. On the Q Acoustics website, all their 3000-series home theatre packages use Q3010i bookshelves, never Q3020 or Q3030. https://www.qacoustics.com/collections/home-theater/
--- 92809025
>>92808903
There are no specific criteria for music or movie sound for front left and right.
Consider that the Q3030i are unusually deep.
The plan to use smaller speakers first, then upgrade to larger ones and putting the small ones to the back is a good one.
--- 92809071
>>92808903
It's more than fine. It's a great way to save money.

Don't worry about "music speakers" or "movie speakers". Good speakers measure well, and Q Acoustics makes some pretty good speakers.

You'll absolutely want a subwoofer or two with them, but these are alright speakers for $330 a pair if the A130s are $400 a pair. Where I am, they're $550 a pair right now, so that's why I was recommending waiting for the $200 a pair A130.

All right hear me out here. What I want to do is autistic, but I'm trying to find a solution. I want to feed audio sources from both my Nintendo Switch and PC into a single unit, and have that mixed signal be sent to my headphones and speakers, with a toggle switch between which device gets the signal (speakers or headphones.)

My current equipment includes: SMSL PO100, Micca Origen G2, AKG K712, Klipsch The Fives. My PC sends USB to the PO100, which sends SPDIF to the G2. I send line-out to The Fives via 3.5mm, and the amped 3.5mm to my headphones. The Switch currently isn't apart of the setup, I used to have a set of Logitech Z623 and I just sent 3.5mm into the mixer port for both PC &amp; Switch audio, but those died. I got The Fives for free so I'm trying to come up with a way to have the same functionality. I think it may work if I send USB from both my PC &amp; Switch into a dual female to single male usb cable, and feed that into the PO100; this way the G2 can just function normally as it has been, but both outputs consist of the mixed sources. I have no idea idea if that'll actually work, because I don't know how the PO100 will deal with it.

Any ideas? Honestly I'm ok with buying new equipment (dac/amp/mixer) to get the functionally, if it's possible. I'd just not like to spend more than say, $300.
--- 92810644
If power amplifiers do always have 2 terminals for each speaker to connect to regardless of the input source, one of which is a positive and another of which is negative/return, then why is it not the case for headphone connection even up until this day?
I mean 3.5/6.35mm TRRS or 4-pin (mini) XLR plugs at 70-80s should already be a thing, so why not?
--- 92810848
>>92810644
Because speakers are two separate units, so tying their grounds together would mean running one cable between both of them and connecting that to ground at the amp.
Headphones meanwhile have their transducers right near each other in a single assembly so they can get away with running a single ground wire to both drivers. That said, headphones with individual positive and negative connections for both drivers do exist.

I don't know any DAC that accepts two USB connections.

How about you use a different kind of output, say toslink, SPDIF or analog on your computer?
You get a Yamaha A-S801, connect your computer to it (SPDIF, toslink or analog), connect your Switch via USB to it and connect the speakers.
You can then sell all the other stuff to recoup some of your cost.

You will need an actual mixer and 2 sources of analog audio to mix, I don't know of anything that would have USB audio "inputs" to mix.

Realistically speaking you should just plug the audio output of your Switch into your PC's line input and use the PC to do the mixing, that way you don't need to buy anything else. Of course the disadvantage here is that you won't get sound from the Switch if the PC is off.

Present your penis and I'll suck it. You know what kills me? I thought about how cool it would be if my motherboard could just accept aux and output audio via usb. Turns out we've had that ability since forever. Holy fuck I'm goddamn stupid. Setting up line-in worked perfectly with the same exact setup I have. It doesn't matter that I won't be able to hear my switch if my PC is off, I can find a different solution to that if it ever arises, but it shouldn't.

I'm pretty happy with my listening setup, don't think I'll be changing any of the equipment any time soon. I do however have 2 ideas i could improve it for relatively low costs. I've been considering adding some good quality diffusion foam behind the monitors and speakers, they are kinda close to the wall and I've heard that can have negative influence on soundstage so maybe a little room treatment could fix it. Another thing i have to do eventually is getting a proper measurement mic and setting up my EQ properly (I'm using software EQ to be clear, the analog EQ in the technics stack is just there to be pretty lol) as after adding a rel q150 sub into the chain the frequency response under 120hz is a bit of a mess even when judging it by ear. What should I prioritize - room treatment or getting the measurement mic? Cost would probably be more or less the same and I'll get both eventually. Acoustic panel recommendations appreciated, as for the mic I'll just go for the umik1.
Also another question regarding DACs - I've heard opinions that the D50S that i currently use is "clinical and not musical at all" and decided to take the empirical approach and get the E70 velvet that is praised for its "musical" sound to test it. Heard no difference which was half expected as I'm more of a measurements fan than pretty words with no concrete meaning believer but half disappointing cause I hoped I'd hear the difference. I returned it the next day. did I get gaslit into buying a 500$ paperweight in the form of a high end DAC or am I actually deaf?

There are three main goals in room acoustics: diffusion, reflection and absorption. You want the last behind and possibly under your speakers. It might be also worth it to use DSP to reduce the energy a bit around 200Hz, as that is where your table adds gain.
Absorption needs mass however, so you are looking for heavy, yet opencelled material, like certain types of rockwool.
Sadly, any sharp corner becomes reflects sound waves and becomes a mini speaker fucking up the sound stage. But such is live in the near field, not really much you can do.
Do you have a measurement microphone?

Hard to tell really. I recommend you get a component tester for $15 and check all the capacitors. Also a multimeter to make sure there aren't broken solderpads. It takes a lot of time to find some errors, sometimes hours of deep work. The problem is that with running, heat is generated, that can cause expansion and some hair crack in the solder becomes a problem.

Try to see if there is relay clicking when the sound disappears, that might point to a smaller area to test.

If the drivers were dying I'd recommend swapping in some Aliexpress/eBay "for Fostex/Denon" drivers as those will actually give you quite the bass boost, but if they're actually falling apart that's not gonna do much good.

From what I've read the 900X has a bit less bass than the 700 or 500. I'd personally look for a cheap 500X and driver swap that, but that's just me loving to mess with stuff.
Maybe look at the R70X, it's on the high side of your budget but the bass on that should dig a little deeper and fit should be similar.

How do they compare to the 500 series size-wise? Because I tried the 560S and it felt like I was being squeezed.

>>92821958
I just assumed that the 900x was just a straight upgrade to the 700x, but if that's not the case, simply buying another pair of 700x is also an option.

I have the Audio-Technica ATH-M50X and they kinda sound like shit compared to the Jabra Elite 85h I used to have.
The sound just doesn't feel as intense and clear or like it's too far away and lacking energy. It's hard to describe. But sounds just feel less immersive. 
Stuff doesn't feel as surround as it used to either, with the Jabra I could set up sound from many different directions on windows but with the ATH it's just stereo.
They both cost roughly the same and both had great reviews so I don't understand why there's such an audio quality gap.
I'd get another Jabras but their bluetooth connectivity is absolute shit and buggy as hell. If they were wired I'd easily recommend them.
Could something like a sound card help them sound better? I really don't know much about this stuff.

Best bluetooth speaker around $100? I don't mind waiting a few months if there's a sale around $100 on something more expensive.
Don't care if it's portable, in fact if it's marketed and designed as being portable then that makes me think a fair bit of the design and price is going towards that goal even though I don't care about it.
Don't care about audiophile autism where you ask why I'm not streaming FLAC from my home media server to a wired $1000 speaker, I have nice shit in my living room but this is just for my bedroom when I'm going to sleep so I don't want or care about anything more complicated than "output phone audio to it via bluetooth".
Hard to find good info on this specific use-case since basically everything I see online is either assuming portability is important or is hundreds of dollars.

Height channel. They're reflective speakers intended to be aimed at the ceiling.

The answer is no.
A DACs output voltage is meant for preamplifier or amplifier inputs, that is, 2 or 4 volt peak, without much ampere behind it, usually milliamps. The Aiyima 07 has a very high input impedance in the kiloohms range, as all preamp or amps have.
A speaker has a low impedance, typically around 8-4 ohm, that means the output of your DAC is immediately driven into clipping and sounds like shit. Not to mention possible heat death of the ICs.
To get a larger range at your amp, from now 0 to 25% to a more healthy 0 to 50%, just reduce the output from the DAC. Many DACs can change volume (some come with regular preamp functionality and remotes, like the Topping E30).

Yamaha T-S1000. Got mine for 250€.
Last year i got a T-1060 for 40€, a top model from the 80ies, it's awesome.

>>92819302
We'll allow it.

>>92819755
Because they are, objectively, chink shit. They are barely above soundbars. However, fact is, they are above soundbars as well as cheap and plenty. To get fundamentally better sound you have to pay fundamentally more, it's a result per $ thing that makes them attractive.

>>92820037
>Do people actually listen to old school radio these days?
I do, there are two FM stations that are worth listening into at specific times here, one has local news and one has something like "new modern jazz record evening" where i get many of my clues for new music. Neither of them is in my Moodes internet radio list.
Not every radio station is financed by advertisement in the first world.

Yes, the Elac B6.2 is only 20€ more a pair (in Germany), but has vastly better low end.
I would prefer the Elac in any case, on account of their good measurements.
Had the DBR62 for a few weeks, really impressive.

>>92825866
>What is an example of an AV Receiver with a height channel?
Marantz NR1609, but it's a shit device. You can use two of their channels as height if your source has height channels.

Had the same problem, but Pixel 6 Pro, was recommended the MBlu dongle:

However, i took the Pro version, the difference is one has 30mW@32 ohms, the Pro has 60mW@32 ohms.
I got it yesterday, but didn't test it yet, may in an hours or so.

Look at the 9.x and 11.x models. Some 7.x models will have height as an alternative to surround backs. Some might also call the height channels 5.1.2 or similar.
And the lines between the positions are blurred in newer formats. You measure your speakers and the receiver applies sounds to them accordingly.

we replaced the fuse inside and the volume knob now crackles after all the use. The left speaker shorted out and I had to electrical tape the wire at an angle to fix it.

The manual said to have the satellite speakers facing away from you because a stereo matrix decoder supplies surround sound. They sound bad if you have them facing toward you and facing them away makes the audio sound like it is coming from behind or in between the speakers, which gives the illusion of 3D sound.
