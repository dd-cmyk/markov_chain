You are paying for the brand by buying Ducky, Steelseries, Razer, Corsair, Logitech. This applies mildly to Leopold, Filco, Varmilo, and other brands from the late 2000s to early 2010s, which are dated (topre lineups excluded).

I'd like to try one of those split keyboard I sometimes see here.
I want the first one to be cheap. If I like the layout I then will splurge.
Any recommendations?

For those interested in a TKL, the Monsgeek M3 is finally up for preorder. It is a gasket mounted premium aluminum keyboard at just $109.99 or $115.99 for the purple color, the value on this is insanely good even beating the likes of the Keychron Q series.

god i hate this keyboard so much. why does it use such a fucking random layout? seriously, no left windows key, BIG ass enter key, only some media control buttons.
thing is SOLID though, but leaves a lot to be desired.
--- 92812009
>>92811120
mine has a dedicated rgb key, duno whats more retarded.
lucky you can program over it and replace it with something that makes more sense

keychron? I had that too, but i remapped it to be a screenshot macro

Also behold, my cute k6 with cinnamoroll keycaps. wish the frame was white, might paint it one day, but the coating is too nice
--- 92812388
>>92810650
is there a way to build it so it has no bounce or squishy flex like a bottom plate mount? i like solid feeling no flex keyboards
--- 92813328
>>92812388
These keyboards are not very very bouncy. Also flex and bounce are 2 different things. You coud wait for the FR4 plates to make it stiffer and 3D print plate socks to make it completely rigid. I don't think you will notice bounce on this board stock anyway.
--- 92813443
I like these fellas
--- 92813482
>>92813443
literally just garfield recolors. Im yet to see an interesting custom keycap (theyre all the same soulless crap)

i plan on 3d printing some nice keyboard cases and harvest my one non-hotswap kb for the switch housings
aftermarket keycaps will also come out
--- 92814914
Ok so these chink keychron KSA keycaps I recieved today are really enjoyable. I was wondering if the reason I hated my keyboard so much was because I actually hated the OEM profile or cherry and turns out yeah the KSA profile is much easier for someone like me who is not a particularly good typer. I still hate this piece of shit RK84 I had for years but now I feel reassured that I will probably enjoy a nicer board once I get one.

Regarding the keycaps the profile is fucking amazing. If MT3 really is similar then its very good. I used to miss keys and type between the keys and my fingers are nicely guided to the keys now. Pretty thick and sounds great. Font clarity is mostly great but its still keychron and I had only a couple keys with minor defects. Otherwise It's very sharp.

I got the grey and silver set and what they call silver is just white. It looks grayish on the picture but it really is not. Especially when contrasted with the dark gray keys. Purple keys are more lavender and less saturated than the pictures suggest.
Can't wait to get a decent board to put these in.

If you're printing a plate you might as well make it 5mm thick (with cutouts 1.5mm in so the switches can still snap into place).
--- 92822252
Which looks better? The dark caps came with the keyboard while the white ones I bought.
--- 92822266
>>92822252
whatever happened to case color = alpha bg

I didn't choose the color. It was a prebuilt NK87 someone was selling for $100.

But I think im blind I dont see what profile they are?
--- 92822732

The only profile I've seen wooden caps in is OEM.
--- 92822841
>>92822732
>only seen in OEM
dont have an OEM set to use with, so much for that
--- 92822843
>>92822190
I considered making the plate thicker, but I'd rather keep my case as low as possible since it will still need gaskets and a daughter board.

considering getting a monsgeek, what is different between the m1 and m3?
--- 92824701
>>92824009
M1 is a 75% with a knob whereas the M3 is a TKL. One thing to keep in mind is that the Monsgeek M1 is currently the only one with a knob; a very smart move on Monsgeek as having a knob tends to look ugly and out of place on a TKL. The switches offered by Monsgeek are from Akko and are rather limited in selection. Akko CS Jelly Blues for tactiles and Akko CS Silver Switch for linears.
--- 92824801
>>92824701
>as having a knob tends to look ugly and out of place on a TKL
a knob on TKL is fine as long as you don't have somebody retarded designing the board
just place it on pause/break simple as that 
Ill never understand why these keyboard designers need to have it on have it for f13 while pause/break is almost as useless of a button while being in a more optimal position.
--- 92824907
>>92824701
im probably going to get an m1
--- 92825719
use lube and orings and then buy foam for the space bar.
--- 92826803
Anyone know a good exploded 75% case and plate model for 3D printing?
--- 92827254
im new to this stuff and just got a psd60 case. can i add weights into the cutout pic rel? and if so does it matter if i use steel, brass, coins or whatever when it comes to sound?
--- 92827564
>>92827254
That space is for a battery if you go wireless. Weights usually screw to the back, but put whatever you want there as long as its secure.
--- 92827611
>>92827564
not planning on using it wireless. i just have some left over steel from a welding project that perfectly fits the cutout but i was reading that brass was good for the sound signature or some shit.
--- 92827690
>>92827611
put your dick inside it, sure it fits
--- 92827716
>>92827690
my dick didnt even fit in your mother and shes as loose as they come
--- 92827756
>>92827611
You can put foam between the case and pcb to deaden the noise. Some people complain that aluminium cases "ping" but I've never worried about their sound. Steel should be fine.
--- 92828193
I need like 30 neutral position keycaps for like $5.
What's the move?
--- 92828432
>>92802623 (OP)
>applies mildly to Leopold
well hell, who else around sells mechs that look like the beige crap i used as a kid? the fc900r pretty much fits the bill for me so far.
--- 92829310
I'm looking for a 100% ISO UK keyboard, but I want it to have a knob for volume and media keys. I'd settle for the knob only if it can be pressed in to pause or double pressed to skip a track

My wish is one like the gmmk where I can just slot in switches but I'd be perfectly happy with a complete keyboard
--- 92829518
Quick question, do low-profile switches (cherry low-profile and kailh choc) use the same mounting holes as regular mx switches?
--- 92829602
>>92829518
no
and cherry switches are extra scratchy
--- 92829772
Hey guys. I'm poor as fuck and I can afford maximum $50 on a keyboard.
I really like typing on my IdeaPad's keyboard, but when I'm on the desk I can't put the notebook in front of the screen...
I like the big enter and shift keys because I hit them with my pinky when programming. I also need arrow keys and F1-F12.
What would be a budget tiny keyboard that suits my needs? It can be either mechanical or chiclet-style like the Lenovo's.
--- 92829970
>>92829518
Absolutely not. No low profile switch currently available is cross compatible with anything but itself right now. However Gateron low profile switches can accept plenty of regular keycaps while being way thinner. Any cherry keycap that have the stem flush with the keycap base can be fitted onto gateron. 
Trying out an ISO Keychron K3 pro low profile right now with these switches and it's looking pretty good. Going to put some PBT on this because the factory caps on ISO boards are painted dogshit even though they are pretty thick.
The board sounds very muted but very consitant. Great for office use. It also has the best factory stabs I ever used.
