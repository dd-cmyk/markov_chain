Did they ever release the first episode uncensored or am I gonna have to buy the BD?
--- 251308051
Even AT-X was censored; I doubt the BD will be uncensored.
--- 251308103
>>251307870 (OP)
Even in the manga only the first volume was uncensored, doubt the anime will be that.

--- 251311265
>>251311164
I was talking about the anime. You mean even Cuckoo's anime has more interest than this?
--- 251311275
>>251307870 (OP)
Tezuka Productions retained censorship of nude scenes in Isekai Maou Omega and Mahou Tsukai Reimeiki on BDs so I doubt this will break the pattern.

Most of the people making said posts are just the same 5-10 or so people who make the same ritual posts every thread and for every show. I bet at least some of them don't even read or watch the series: they don't actually care, they just want to use it as a way to continue their proxy war.

The fact that the anime got greenlighted to begin with is surprising.
--- 251331141
>>251331104
It's funny how things work. People on /a/ have been complaining about how pantyshots have been disappearing from anime for a while now, and here's an anime that has multiple and they're still complaining.

Also, nipple censorship and steam/light censorship isn't a new thing. That's been around for ages now. I don't get why it's now a problem all of a sudden. And before people go "oh the nipples won't be uncensored in the BDs either", it's worth noting that the manga barely had any nipples to begin with either and apart from vol 1 still remained censored even in the tanks.
--- 251331165
>>251331129
What I want to know is if Japan like this more than either Fuuka or Cuckoo.
--- 251331208

--- 251332424

The beginning of the story is very weak and standard. The more it goes on, the more it develops its own identity and you'll see why it gets a lot of attention
--- 251332484
>>251330088
This is why she must win
--- 251332497
>>251318165
It doesn't count if the girl is willingly flashing them. Riho is a slut.
--- 251332825
No girl walks around in panties like that unless she's expecting to get some dicking. Also, she shaved.

That's "fine" (it's not but let's no fight), but if they're going to make everyone spinsters then it should actually be relevant to the setting. Every single one of these girls could be 12 years old and nothing material would change.
--- 251337479
this scene definitely looked censored with white boxes. I think it will be uncensored but still have smaller light beams under it.

b4 it started, gave up on this, then reconsidered for the possible ecchi/panties, u name it.Said,it's worth a try, there will be maids/waitresses, so 100% it will be fanservice.
It started, girls are bitchy as hell, and fanservice is clearly the only reason I'm gonna finish this awkward series.
--- 251338301
so pink = tsundere, twintail = slut, and ponytail = retard. what are the other two girls supposed to be?
--- 251338380
>>251331104
it might be because it's kind of condensed from the manga, so you're getting like 3 fanservice scenes in one episode rather than having them in 1 chapter

Weird how none of their good anime like Shinsekai Yori, Attack on Titan, Parasyte, Made in Abyss, Death Note, Code Geass, etc., have this bottom of the barrel "Japanese humour", huh?
It seems like more competent writers put more effort into their "jokes" rather than relying on trashy troupes because they actually respect their male characters.

Abe just wanted everyone to have sex. He would not be proud of his efforts being wasted like this.

Yeah. Kishida made non consensual sex crime law to take Freedom away from Japan. Even Turaga Dume is better than them. Kishida should have been killed by explosives last time. (Change Chinese banner to Japanese, Panda to Nito Yumeno, LGBT and feminist symbol on Gate, Japanese to China on pic and it would be same as now) Even China won't make this law. China has no feminists.
--- 251373693

Broad trends of "censorship" (which is really more a toning down of fanservice compared to the manga, which has been going on for decades anyway) are not proof of a ban on bikinis. Make whatever other complaints you want to about "censorship", but stop saying there's a ban on bikinis when there isn't.

To be clear, I'm not the one who was shitting on Japanese humour, just the one shitting on American humour. Japanese humour has its stupidities but is overall fine, British humour has its stupidities but is over all fine, Amercian humour has more stupidities but at least has its okay moments too. No idea if the original guy was actually British or not, but the Brits aren't the only ones to spell that way and be racist to Japanese.

Nah, no additional people would give a shit about the show. If anything there'd be less people posting because no-one would be whining about the lack of nipples.

For me.

But people would be posting more screencaps.

She's used goods. Ami is the only pure one.

The anime onlies are repulsed by the creepy roastoids in this show and are dropping it. Just look at the Crunchyroll comments.

Honestly it wouldn't surprise me if this ends up being the last thread for the anime to reach bump limit (except maybe the last episode's). I remember Fuuka's anime threads being pretty dead towards the end except for the episode where Fuuka (didn't) get trucked, so I guess it's par for the course.

What the fuck is wrong with you

Like it or not, that's where you will find most of the anime-onlies rather than manga readers larping as anime-onlies.

>>251389846
But why do you need to see reactions from so many genuine anime-onlies?

To see if they are as repulsed by those subhumans as I am. They are seemingly repulsed by them, but not as much as me.
That Todai cock deserves better.

A healthier reaction to not liking the characters in a series would be to just not watch it and stop thinking about it. But this isn't the place for people who do mentally healthy things, is it?

>>251390215
Yes. I am indeed dropping this.

What kind of shows do mentally ill "people" such as this enjoy?

What's her alcohol-induced body count? Has she ever had a train run on her at a mixer?
--- 251395530
>>251395450
Even if she has, she's still more pure than Riho.

Shinsekai Yori, Attack on Titan, Made in Abyss, Code Geass, Death Note, Evangelion are a few that I like.
Among romcoms, I only remember liking Tsurekano because any rom"com" where a female lays her hands on the boys is an automatic drop and rated 1 for me. I'm open to other good romcom recommendations like Tsurekano where the MC has self-respect.
