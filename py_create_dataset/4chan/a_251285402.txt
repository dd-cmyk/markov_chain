Kinda? It was a seminal moment for the future identity of Japan and in the 90's there was a lot of craze for it.

--- 251294107
Is this good? Bit disappointed that the author went with a female football team story instead of a male one
--- 251294149
>>251294107
I went in not expecting to like it, but these little criminals are entertaining to watch.
--- 251294153
>>251294107
The gender dynamics and the state of female soccer is a pretty important theme of the manga. It would be extremely different if it was a male team. 
Anyways, it's pretty damn good.
--- 251294446
>>251294107
The cast is very fun, and the matches are pretty good. What else could a man want?

--- 251331939
>>251323448
I feel bad for her harem. 
They'll have to take 'drastic action' one of these days.
--- 251331977
>>251324542
She's smart. 
Just focused on the stuff that actually matters, like scoring. 
Defense is for people that aren't good enough to play an important position.
--- 251332086
>>251323819
>>251323839
>>251323866

>>251331857
The anime sucks. 
Onda is a shit talking gorilla, but its not a constant for her.
--- 251332340
>>251331977
Defence is for tall and genetically strong players, also the best position for captains.
>>251332119
I see
--- 251332412
>>251331857
I don't know shit about blue lock, but there's a fair amount of banter, especially between Suo and Tsukuda.
However, the anime should be avoided. It's a downgrade from the manga.

Done. I can't believe our girls are actually winning matches. Must be the power of Shiratori bullying.
Are you a suspicious character?
See you tomorrow!

You don't understand, her football instinct is so strong that she can't help but score on the nearest goal she senses.

They unleashed the Swan.
--- 251364031
>>251363491
They made a pass that looked like it was to Onda, but Suo intercepted and made a pass to Shiratori, who scored.

That implies that Tase is at least somewhat cool.

AKA the cutback + pass. This strat can be performed by either your wingers (forwards that play wide) or alternatively, Full Backs with the stamina and offensive mentality to play up the pitch known as Wing Backs.
--- 251367288
>>251363209
Thanks OP.

I don't understand these people, Onda is easily the 3rd smartest girl on the short bus.
--- 251369788

Onda confirmed to be stupid.

Man City before this season uses a variation of it where you feed the ball to your wingers, and then they passed it to the MF who run into the channels and then cutback. It's why City's MF is actually converted wingers like KDB and Bernardo.
--- 251371618
>>251363209
Yes.
I used to go for night walks and jogs but kept getting pulled over by the police so I had to stop. 
I am naturally very suspicious.

--- 251373894
>>251364031
>>251363491
no, it's own goal . Suo crossed the ball, but the defender intercepted it in to her own goal
--- 251374711
>>251373894
Either way, all was thanks to the presence of the Swan.
--- 251375230
>>251370238
Well yeah, Tase was the whole reason Suo joined tbe Warabies, which also dragged Sossy along.
--- 251375378
>>251371603
To be fair, overloading the frontline with both the wingers and the wingbacks plus either the CF or a MF joining from second line is a staple of Pep's positional play. If anything, Man City's actual difference this year is that they implement this tactic with an actual 9 instead of a false 9 or a second forward converted into the role.

Is Tsukuda that one ugly friend women have to make themselves look better by comparison to Ito? Or is the roll cake addict too naive for that advanced strat?

Tase is definitely one of the players of all time.
