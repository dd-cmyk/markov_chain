Because you're using an if statement, you can only use JS expressions inside JSX, e.g. className={sliderRef &amp;&amp; sliderRef.current.scrollLeft &lt; 500 ? "" : ""}
--- 92798539
>>92798344
because you can't assign a prop like that, blocks don't evaluate to their last expression, it isn't like Rust or Scala or whatever. in your case, just use a ternary.
--- 92798583
>>92798493
>>92798539
I tried a ternary but it the refs returns null
maybe it's because MdChevronLeft renders earlies that div.slider and so the ref to slider is null?
--- 92799246
>>92798583
it seems like you are writing code without knowing what the code does. in this case it is because the ref hasn't yet been assigned on the first render: How could sliderRef.current refer to anything if nothing has been rendered yet?
change the ternary to:
sliderRef.current &amp;&amp; sliderRef.current.scrollLeft > 500
  ? firstListOfDuplicatedClassNames
  : otherRetardedListOfDuplicatedClassNames

It's because that it's detached from JS in the sense that it's compiler basically changes the way variable assignments work. Also one component per file kind of sucks when you're still brainstorming how you actually want to segment your components.

Aight guys, I'm at a crossroads...
Do I
>continue going balls deep into Go and learn how to actually program and get some gigatier job making bank, but will likely take another 2 years go really git gud
>go back to C# which is now infinitely easier thanks to actually learning some basics from the Go, slap some MVC and API projects together and go get a decent job in like 3-6 months? I make $45k atm and I'm not hurting for money, but going from that to like 70-90 would be pretty cool. Job market around here is mainly .net, but Go jobs seem to be mostly remote anyway and pay 2-3x as much.

Either way I'm beginning to think I need adderal or something. I'm constantly drawn to the next thing and can't seem to just stick with something after getting to an intermediate level with it.
--- 92799775
>>92799737
So if I'm just starting I should aim for Back end?
How does full stack come into this?
--- 92799814
>>92799775
Full stack is a generalist so you're gonna do both. I kinda hate this name bc no one is really full stack most ppl lean more front/back with a large majority leaning front. You'll get a job easier with front end as it is a bit more accessible generally for folks starting out as far as technical knowledge of concerned.

--- 92800010
>>92796418 (OP)
Some jewtuber told me that nobody hires a newbie programmer as a back end developer, but that they only hire for front end shit and then gradually move to back end or full stack jobs, is this true?
--- 92800070
>>92800010
would make sense, a junior has to familiarise themselves with OWASP/best security practices when working with backend, else their shit is fucked
--- 92800092
>>92800010
I know I wouldn't, ever
--- 92800184
>>92800010
Depends on the company honestly. Jr Devs are generally seen as retards who will need at least 6 months before they are expected to return value to the company since they need to learn the ropes and quirks of X code base. 
When hiring for a backend dev, if a Jr candidate has demonstrated their worth and promise, he will be hired and raised like a baby by the gray beards until he has shown sufficient knowledge of doing things and abiding by certain practices. 
Not impossible but, per the reasons you stated, not as easy as front end. Silver lining is that backend has less competition
--- 92800417
>>92796731
Follow the React docs and some get started doc for whatever backend framework you want to use.
Start with your personal blog. Then come up with a basic idea for what you want to make.
--- 92800463
>>92800070
>best security practices
Funny how everyone acts like they know what this is. I guess it's a big game where everyone pretends they know what they're doing and when things break (often) they just blame it on someone else.
I think the reality is that 99% of people who think they know security are outright lying or are ignorant.
The 1% who really know it get ignored because it would cost money to do something as complicated as stop storing raw passwords in text files on public servers.

I'm trying to sort a list of files using multiple criteria. My approach so far is to simply use Array.filter() with one conditional after another. It is working but it's kinda slow (couple seconds) even though I'm using a short list. Is there any way to make this shit faster? I have looked at UI libraries and the only one that does multiple criteria is https://tanstack.com/table/v8/docs/examples/react/filters

Any ideas or other component/library suggestions?
--- 92800754
>>92800590
>It is working but it's kinda slow (couple seconds) even though I'm using a short list

You got to share us the component in question. It's possible that it's not the filter but your re-renders. Run the react profiler.

What is the best way to position:absolute an element relative to another element that IS NOT the parent?
--- 92803908
Is it okay to store state at the App level in React? I guess the downside is that it causes the entire App function to re-run when there's a re-render

The alternative is that I make a context provider component, and store the state on that. It will be slightly lower down the tree so less code will run on re-renders, I think.

So at the moment it's something like:
export default function App() {
  const [things, setThings] = useState([]);

  return (
    &lt;Whatever>
      &lt;AnotherWhatever>
        &lt;ThingContext.Provider value={{ things, setThings }}>
          {/* Children */}
        &lt;/ThingContext.Provider>
      &lt;/AnotherWhatever>
    &lt;/Whatever>
  );
}

But maybe I should extract the provider into a component and store the state on that, like this:
export default function ThingProvider({ children }) {
  const [things, setThings] = useState([]);

  return (
    &lt;ThingContext.Provider value={{ things, setThings }}>
      {children}
    &lt;/ThingContext.Provider>
  );
}


Thoughts?
--- 92804012
YO
what is this
--- 92804093
>>92803908
Keeping it localized is more preferable as you can control when it re-renders, but keep in mind to keep your context values very simple, unless you don't mind all the components that call useContext to re-render whenever the context value changes.
--- 92804396
>>92804093
I do want the components using useContext to re-render so that's okay

I think I will make the `ThingProvider` component and store state on that. It's probably a very minor optimisation but it might make a very small difference.

How to filter such an object?
[
  { parentid: 1 },
  { parentid: 2 },
  { parentid: 3, child: { id: 4 } },
  { parentid: 5, child: { id: 6 } },
]

I need to pass an id and filter out an object with that id, no matter if it's parent or child
so, if id is 2 then I need to filter out { parentid: 2}
but if id is 6, I need to filter out child: { id: 6 } but keep { parentid: 5 }
--- 92804680
>>92804516
not sure if I understood what you meant but this works for example
--- 92804818
>>92798380
Thanks sir. Will soon be finished, will post it here for beta test
--- 92804946
>>92804680
Thanks but that's not exactly what I need since parent might have many children
I managed to come up with something but that's ugly

And there might not be a child with specified id, so that assignment: parent.children = parent.children.filter(.....) is absolutely useless
--- 92805558
>>92801822
>I dont care eventually care if user will experience browser reloads
The whole industry is thankfully shifting back to server side rendering and server side generation. If you just want a static site/blog, use Hugo or Astro - these are SSG frameworks where you just have a folder for markdown files that get rendered and cached in memory at server startup - no databases, lowish amount of code, but can still make a secondary back end to do other stuff you want, and they load exceptionally fast. Java/Spring is a full blown batteries included framework and will pull in commonly needed dependencies for things like authentication, ORM/database calls, MVC structure, etc. 

If you're already a ways into your project and really want to use a front end and job prospects don't matter then Svelte is by far the best to work with and only takes like an hour to learn it well enough to do most things. The others are fine, but svelte's learning curve is definitely the lowest, and it's also the highest preforming one out of the ones that you've listed.

how do you animate components when they enter and leave the DOM?
tried synchronizing a portal with useEffect but it's becoming a mess
--- 92807393
okay webdevfags, I'm trying to do a simple site with websockets and static pages, I've been using fastify to serve the static files and the websocket route and that works fine, the problem is that typescript is fucking autistic (why do we let microsoft write any standards, ever?) and javascript modules are retarded
I've been recommended Vite, but I'm not actually sure what it would be helpful for, since I need to be able to do a websocket route in the backend and don't care about SSR and all I can find on mixed fastify/vite seems to be talking about doing SSR, also I'm not sure vite would actually help building the server typescript
what would be the best way to do out-of-source (build to dist/) typescript on both server and browser (being able to share code and types as well)?
--- 92807402
>>92806853
? As always?
--- 92807679
>>92806853
Me? Never used CSS animations. Could never be fucked. I just stick to the fundamentals. Your HTMLs, your Flexboxes, your Reacts, your backends.
--- 92807767
>>92807402
enter and leave as in conditionally rendered in the jsx
&lt;>
  {open &amp;&amp; createPortal(&lt;ModalContent>, document.body)}
&lt;/>


currently I am using a visible state variable in ModalContent to do the animation:
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";

import styles from "./ModalContent.module.css";

type Props = { onClose: () => void };

const ModalContent = ({ onClose }: Props) => {
  const [visible, setVisible] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    setTimeout(() => setVisible(true), 80);
  }, []);

  const handleClose = () => {
    setVisible(false);
    onClose();
  };

  return (
    &lt;aside>
      &lt;div
        className={`${styles.backdrop} ${visible ? styles.visible : ""}`}
        onClick={handleClose}
      />
      &lt;div className={`${styles.container} ${visible ? styles.move : ""}`}>
        &lt;h1>Loading...&lt;/h1>
      &lt;/div>
    &lt;/aside>
  );
};

export default ModalContent;


the onClose() triggers another state, which in itself triggers and useEffect which closes the modal after a timeout, this is why I think it's probably a mess, i don't know if it's okay

Well it depends on how nested your thing is. If it's just what you've shown then just simply create a function to filter it.

 const filterObj = (input, index) => {
 let x = input.filter(item => item.parentid === index)
 if (x.length === 0){
 let y = input.filter(item => Object.values(item).length>1)
 return y.filter(items => (Object.values(items).filter(item => item.id === index)).length>0)
 }
 return x
 }

However you should change parentid to id if it is nested so you can loop through it for more complicated files. Idk I'm only just applying for jobs and I have no degree or tech experience. Works for me.

Let's say I want to send a message to a WebSocket client in one of my route handlers

Should I store my connected WebSocket clients in the database?

Currently they're in a JavaScript Set of `clients` (yes my backend is Node), but traversing that Set to find the correct client to send the message to probably won't scale very well. Querying the database to find the client I want is probably faster.

For a friend or relative, I may very well do that. Your reaction simply shows that you have no sense of community. And I guess that's fine, not everyone needs to have that, but there is somewhat of a traditional community amongst programmers. The only thing that worries me is that it might be falling apart as time goes on, and I would dearly miss it.

Many programmers do it for the money, and don't share their work for free. In fact I think every programmer I've known in real life has been like that. I'm not aware of major open source contributions from any of them. And this is a group of, I dunno, up to 10 programmers I guess.

That has absolutely zero to do with getting a job offer.
I helped interview someone and they weren't able to do even the most basic tasks in the programming language they said they'd spent the last 5 years doing. I talked with the hiring manager about it and the other interviewers had similar stories, but they liked the person's personality or something so they hired them anyway.
Lesson learned: don't worry about learning a skill. Don't waste time with getting good. Just lie. Lie on your resume, lie in the interview, and when they catch you lying just shrug your shoulders. Sure fire way to get a job.

alright, I finally made my baby's first backend. had a feel of dealing with routes, using middlewares and had contact with the most basic basic modules 
I'd move on to databases now so I can crud.
BUT.
Using WSL is making everything a colossal pain in the ass.
So I'll skip to learning about deploying
I thought of giving cloudflare a try but chat gpt called me a retard and something something CDN not meant for backend.

What direction should I go so I can get a feel of deploying? vercel? I haven't even reached the build stage. not even sure about structure actually. so far I have a project folder with nothing but a backend and a frontend folder.
the frontend is a template quasar app with nothing but a fetch to the backend added to it. the backend is an express app that only returns a json object just so you can know it exists.

Diet, exercise, sleep, and maybe cut back on caffeine.

Fasting seems to help sometimes, not every day but from time to time.
I felt better when I started taking vitamin supplements like iron and b-complex.
Weight lifting helps to some degree.

I am trying to solve picrel (selecting diagonal cells - HTML DOM Table)

My thought process is that I need to solve the following conditions:
1. Select the table which is given. let table = document.body.firstElementChild;

2. Select a &lt;tr> and shade(change background color) the value equal to "i" (using a for loop) then increment it by 1 before moving to the next row.
3. The "i" must be remembered across all rows.
4. The script must stop 


The table is in the link but it is basically just a table with 5 &lt;tr> elements which contain 5 &lt;td> elements each

We realized that having huge blobs of JS on the client to completely render our whole site was a bad idea in terms of performance for the user, prone to crash, as well as led to waterfall requests with loading UIs. Ultimately quite an awful experience.

Has any of you figured out twitter data scraping? I'm looking at GETs but I can't figure out how the site tracks records to load (for example in followers tab) and how certain keys are generated.

Taking the profile's followers for example, each query to fetch more users has only variables:
>"userId"
>"count"
>"cursor"
>"includePromotedContent"
count is always 20 by default, userId is self-explainatory, promo content is a bool and cursor is a pair of numbers - my guess is it's reading the cursor position

Also, when accessing data you usually have a generated character string in the url, for example

Why are you crying like the little bitch that you are, you fucking retard? Jesus Christ I didn't think it was possible to be as much of a little bitch as you.
--- 92828150

I'm just calling out how retarded your post was. Try not to get offended like a little boy next time.

It wasn't retarded at all. It made perfect sense but you're crying like a little bitch over it, because you're a little bitch.
--- 92828340

You don't even know what generics are. I literally do not care what you think.

So by pure chance it sometimes works under certain circumstances. That is also of no surprise considering the fact that it was trained on data which probably also came from stackoverflow et al. Still, it is not made for coding and therefore it should not be surprising to anybody, that it won't work for that.

I see it as a tool that is useful if you know what you are doing.
I've been using it for a week and none of the code it generated was free of flaws, some minor, some major, and sometimes it didn't work at all. I gave up trying to replicate Pong and I could find a working implementation using google in 5 minutes.
So my tl;dr take at this point is that anyone thinking this shit can replace them, then it is entirely their fault for being shit at their job.

It's always great to create screen reader friendly websites.
I always do my best, and at the same time I make sure said websites break for apple users.

You posting like an underage boy. So far you've shown you don't know shit about programming, with your midwit question and even more retarded reply. Also

cors can be bypassed (or spoofed) with local tools, right? it seems it is something only enforced by the browser

looks pretty good to me. even if it does error out, you just paste the error to it and it'll fix it

i've had issues with api's before
having to go actually find the api docs and copy paste shit in over and over till i find the correct one lol

coming from amatuer gamedev i thought webdev would be easy, but man you guys just seem to have trash docs for everything
