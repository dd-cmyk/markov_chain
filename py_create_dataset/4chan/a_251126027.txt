>Oh yes because its so much worse than all the same 'x wearing y' or 'x doing generic mudane thing' that people only draw because it involves a fotm waifu.
Yes, it's worse because you are requesting not just niche but convoluted shit and getting mad because it's not getting delivered, or course a simple request is going to get more chances to get deliver and a fotm is going to have higher chancer because it's popular and will have a wide range of people that could be interested. You're even crying because other people get better deliveries and get upset because the ones you got aren't that great but you sould be thankful that a drawfag used his precious time doing them, no matter the skill level, most of drawfags are beginner and mid level that want to learn of just pass the time, they don't own you shit and if you really want an actual pro to draw for you then just go a commission it.

>>251166952
Well, aside from most anons being straight men, thus their interests primarily lie with the female body over the male one. The other thing is that it's where if you study something like anatomy, portraits or figure drawing, you'll be drawing men rather often anyways. Primarily because men are a easier study subject, their muscles and bones are easier to notice and thus memorize their placement in the body, compared to the female body who has per usual more body fat distributed and less muscles and bones popping out on average. So it's also just a nice change of the usual subjects that you'd draw when learning or practicing.

This is a drawthread so if you're just going to input some prompts and post it just save your time because you're just going to get thrashed. But if you are going to use it to add a a background or adding color (this could trigger some people but you could add the version without color) i think it's fine

I don't, I am trying to learn to do digital art and since I have no imagination I went here to see if I could find some ideas. Coloring is harder than I thought.This is the first colored drawing I made and posted online, I think. But since I'm learning how to use all this stuff, by the time I finish a drawing I don't like it anymore already. At some point I just gave up, pasted a shark and sent it.

If you like more than just anime characters, there are several drawthreads on other boards to grab ideas from.
>At some point I just gave up, pasted a shark and sent it.
Don't get discouraged anon, many artists have a hard time going from paper to digital (unless I am wrong in assuming that, and you've always drawn digital and this is your first coloring?). I think its pretty good. Are you drawing with a mouse or tablet pen?
If you wanted a bit of feedback, I think you'd likely see a bit more of her right arm. The plastic nose piece should fill out the area, and her right eye could use some adjustment, as it looks like the pupil is inwards a bit while the other is more centered, like she is doing half a cross-eye.

I mean that I gave up on that one drawing because as I said I didn't like it that much.
>unless I am wrong in assuming that, and you've always drawn digital and this is your first coloring?
I just started drawing digitally that's why I can't even do straight lines. And before that I didn't draw a lot anyway. Only last week I started taking art seriously, I hope that if I make many drawings I'll get good.
>If you wanted a bit of feedback, I think you'd likely see a bit more of her right arm. The plastic nose piece should fill out the area, and her right eye could use some adjustment
Thank you, I knew about the eye, I have never done anime style. But since I was trying to focus more on the coloring and digital line art I didn't try to fix it too much.

why are you pushing religion in your drawings when no one asked for it? it is bad enough its in the post text (cringe), but you taint the drawings you make for others when they in no way asked for you to include a blessing from your imaginary sky person. its so out of place and your art is no more than /beg/ level children's scribbles. go peddle your bible verses elsewhere and maybe pick up a book and actually learn how to draw.

Is this traditional art or very good digital?

It's oil on a canvas board, but I also ran the photo through a color filter to warm it up because its not dry enough for me to glaze the last layers yet

You sound like an absolute faggot. Like I mean that with all of my heart. Not even hating the lgbtq here. 

Are you always this bitter and angry? Just ignore the art if you don't like it. Their art is cute and comfy.

Stop being such a fag and just vibe.

Not even jesus loving. It's just one anon being an absolute cunt for no reason at all.

The art was free and the artist is very wholesome. There was no need to be as much of an asshat as >>251335216
was.

Literally don't like? Don't look/read. Like I know this is 4chan but we don't have to come at each others throats all the time. We're here to have fun and shitpost at the end of the day.

Requesting something like right pic related with Daijin from Suzume no Tojimari.
--- 251369237
>>251368302
Yes her, let me guess, you're an animeonly who watched the dub that used the shitty viz translations that their translator admitted to having Pitou's gender wrong but instead of fixing it they just stopped using pronouns in the later episodes.

--- 251370650

Quick sketch, was this similar to the bunny girl Eyjafjalla you wanted?
Just a sketch right now so i can change anything if you want
--- 251371294
>>251370650
Yes, the dub kept calling Pitou a he while the Japanese subs always referred to her as a female. In the official raws for the manga Pitou technically never gets referred as any pronoun but Togashi clearly decided to make her female after her first appearance since she immediately got a more feminine redesign.

I've been having trouble getting in the mood to draw. Does anybody want a girl drawn in fighting pose? Can't guarantee a delivery since everything seems to come out too fucked up for me to want to deliver, but I promise I'll try.

requesting Sachi in the nude and touching herself on Hiro's bed. Just a generic blue color. Have her smelling a shirt or his pillow if you want to.
